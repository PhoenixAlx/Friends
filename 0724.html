<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know! Monica&#146;s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her
something new?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash
last night.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is
pregnant. The groom is missing. And I&#146;m still holding this. (She throws the test back
into the trash.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was
using?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Why?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Ross is just hanging up the phone as Rachel and Phoebe
enter.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Anything?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn&#146;t heard from him. I-I-I
talked to Chandler&#146;s parents again!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You told them he was missing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both
think I&#146;m interested in them.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, we&#146;ve got to tell her he&#146;s gone. (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! Hey! Hey! We can&#146;t!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, she&#146;s gonna start getting ready soon!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, can&#146;t you at least stall her a little? I&#146;ll-I&#146;ll go
back to some of the places I went last night.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, well how much time do you need?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> One hour.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Give me two.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then why do you ask?!</p>

<p>(They all go into the hallway.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, wish me luck.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. I&#146;m going with you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ross, you&#146;re tired. You&#146;ve been looking all night. And clearly
you suck at this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, I&#146;ll see you guys later.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Wait, do you know how you&#146;re going to stall her?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;ll figure something out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. Good luck.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p>(Phoebe and Ross go to look for Chandler and Rachel enters Monica and Chandler&#146;s.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey! Okay, so I thought we&#146;d start with my make up and then do my
hair.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> About what?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm&#133; I&#146;m never gonna getting married!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we
done with that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No Monica! I&#146;m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Any woman would be lucky to have ya.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (jumping up) Rachel! You okay?</p>

<p>[Scene: The Movie Set, Joey is reporting for work.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little
problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn&#146;t supposed to work today, and I have
this wedding that I really have to be at. It&#146;s my best friend&#146;s, and I&#146;m
officiating so I really can&#146;t work past four.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can&#146;t stop filming
just for you. It&#146;s not like it&#146;s your wedding. (Starts to walk away.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;m having surgery!</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn&#146;t
want you to worry about me. But, I&#146;m having surgery today.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> What kind of surgery?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Transplant.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> But you&#146;re supposed to work on Monday.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hair transplant.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> But you&#146;re not bald.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s not on my head.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Look Joey, there&#146;s nothing I can do. Besides, you&#146;re
probably gonna be out by four anyway. We&#146;ve just got one short scene. It&#146;s just
you and Richard, and God knows he&#146;s a pro. You&#146;ll be fine. (Walks away and sees
Richard entering.) Morning Richard.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! You&#146;re here! Great! Great! Great! Let&#146;s get going buddy,
we&#146;ve got a scene to shoot!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> I&#146;m wearing two belts.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you drunk?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes you are!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> All right.</p>

<p>[Scene: A Street, Phoebe and Ross are exiting a pizza place.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We are never gonna find him! He&#146;s one guy in a huge city!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That is an old, Chinese woman!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He could be in disguise, y&#146;know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Aw, y&#146;know&#133;Y&#146;know, maybe we&#146;re-we&#146;re just
approaching this all wrong. If you&#146;re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the
last place on Earth people would think you&#146;d go?</p>

<p>[Cut to an office building.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So this is your office?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How did you guys find me? I knew I should&#146;ve hid at the gym!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What the hell are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I&#146;m
related to Monica. How is she?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She&#146;s fine. She doesn&#146;t know you&#146;re gone. And she
doesn&#146;t have to know, okay? Now come on, we&#146;re going home.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! No! No! I can&#146;t do that!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why not?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because if I go home, we&#146;re gonna become the Bings! I can&#146;t
be the Bings!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s wrong with being the Bings?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use
the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to
your hotel room?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Then you are neither of your parents!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at
everybody&#146;s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And
I&#146;ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don&#146;t race cars! I don&#146;t make popcorn!
None of my proceeds go to charity.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I
do. But I totally believe you can do this.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I want to. I love her so much, but I&#146;m afr&#133;It&#146;s too
huge.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&#146;know, okay. You&#146;re right. It is huge. So why don&#146;t we
take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just
forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well yeah, but then&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (interrupting him) Yeah&#151;No-but-but-but-but! We&#146;re just gonna go
home and take a shower. Now, that&#146;s not scary right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Depends on what you mean by we.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is still trying to stall Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes!
And that&#146;s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm,
Rachel I&#146;m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I&#146;m getting married today!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. At dusk. That&#146;s such a hard time for me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (getting up) I&#146;m gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the
hotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. But wait!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let&#146;s go to lunch.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&#146;t go to lunch!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>

<p>(Monica goes into the bathroom and Rachel thinks quickly.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh good God! I&#146;ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. All right. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I&#146;m
about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love
you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, you&#146;re-you&#146;re really freaking me out.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We can&#146;t find Chandler&#133;(Phoebe sticks her head and motions
that they found Chandler)&#151;&#145;s vest. We can&#146;t find Chandler&#146;s vest.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Found the vest! I mean we&#146;re gonna have to keep an eye
on it, y&#146;know make sure we don&#146;t lose it again&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh wow! Okay. Don&#146;t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute
there I was like, &quot;Oh my God! The worst has happened!&quot; </p>

<p>(Monica goes into the bathroom and Phoebe and Rachel breathe a sigh of relief.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Movie Set, Joey and Richard are in the middle of a scene. They are both
holding swords.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> That can be arranged.</p>

<p>(Richard thrusts, misses Joey by several feet and Joey screams in pain and drops to his
knees.)</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Let&#146;s reset.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Let&#146;s take it from there.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> (To Joey) Are you a little off today? It&#146;s going terribly slowly.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And
I&#146;m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Of course! I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry. I-I&#146;d hate you to miss
anything like that on account of me. I can do this!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Still rolling, annnnd action!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Now, that can be arranged! (He brings his sword back and drops it,
causing it to fly over the wall.) Slippery little bugger!</p>

y&#146;know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well,
y&#146;know. I mean there&#146;s no way Joey&#146;s gonna make it in time. So I&#146;m

we&#146;ve got guests seated, and Chandler starts walking down the aisle with his parents
on either arm.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Bing:</b> Our little boy is getting married.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh look at you! So handsome!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look
beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I&#146;m so glad you
here. (He kisses his mom.)</p>

<p>(He walks up onto the altar and notices the rabbi.)</p>

<p><b>The Rabbi:</b> Are you Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you Joey?</p>

<p>(Ross walks down the aisle with Phoebe and Rachel on his arms.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh. This is nice.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can&#146;t end in
divorce.</p>

<p>(Finally, Monica with her parents on her arms start down the aisle.)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh I wish you&#146;re grandmother had lived to see this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She&#146;s right there.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica on
the cheek.) Congratulations darling.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)</p>

<p>(Chandler steps off the altar to greet his bride-to-be.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not now.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(They both step up onto the altar and she notices the rabbi.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) Who is this?</p>

<p><b>The Rabbi:</b> I am Father Kalebasous.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (in Monica&#146;s ear) He&#146;s Greek Orthodox.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (leaning in) As are you&#133;</p>

<p><b>The Rabbi:</b> Let us begin. Dearly beloved&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) That&#146;s my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I
can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I&#146;m sorry I&#146;m a little
late. You may be confused by this now, (He&#146;s still in costume) but you won&#146;t be
Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let&#146;s get started before the groom takes off again.
Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man
and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I&#146;ve known Monica and Chandler for a
long time, and I can <b>not</b> imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now,
as I&#146;ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?</p>

<p>(She turns to get her vows from Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Rachel) He took off?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, for so long I&#133;I wondered if I would ever find my prince,
my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.
And in stead, I found everything that I&#146;d ever been looking for my whole life. And
now&#133;here we are&#133;with our future before us&#133;and I only want to spend it with
you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don&#146;t want to. You go!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler?</p>

<p>(Ross leans in to give Chandler his vows.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) No, that&#146;s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I
thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I
saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises
that come our way it&#146;s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was
meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I&#146;m sure? (He leans in and
kisses her.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the
state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do
you take each other?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I do.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I do.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah you do!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rings?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Aw crap! Okay&#151;uh&#133;uh let&#146;s-let&#146;s do the rings. </p>

<p>(Chandler and Monica both turn, take the rings from Ross and Rachel respectively, and
place them on each other&#146;s fingers.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To
Chandler) Now kiss her again.</p>

<p>(They kiss and everyone applauds.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What baby?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Our baby.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We have a baby?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I didn&#146;t take a pregnancy test.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then&#133;who did?</p>

<p>[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh and they&#146;re gonna have a baby.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p>(The camera zooms in on Rachel who has a very worried and frightened look on her face
and she slowly takes a deep breath.)</p>

<p>[Fade to black.]</p>
