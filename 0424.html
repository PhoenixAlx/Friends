<b>

<p>Housekeeper:</b> This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is
not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks
for the person with whom one wishes to speak.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>(In a British accent) This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if
it&#146;s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?</p>

<p><b>Housekeeper: </b>Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it&#146;s not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>No no no, I&#146;ll be nice, I swear!!! &nbsp; Could you just give me the
number for where they are?</p>
<b>

<p>Housekeeper: </b>I&#146;m afraid, I&#146;m not at liberty to divulge that information.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn
somebody, alright. So if you don&#146;t give me that number then I&#146;m going to come
over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.</p>
<b>

<p>Housekeeper: </b>Hangs up.</p>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.</p>

Gellers. (She&#146;s still not responding.) She&#146;s very self-absorbed, you know. I
should never have married her.</p>

Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.</p>

(No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long
time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks
embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over
inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear

<p>Felicity: </b>(In a sexy voice.)Hello Joey.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>Hey, Felicity.</p>
<b>

<p>Felicity: </b>Umm, I thought about you all day.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>Yeah.</p>

<b>

<p>Felicity: </b>Mmm. (She pushes him up against the wall and they begin to kiss.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>(Back in the chapel. The parents are still fighting over the bill. Ross is refereeing.)</p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Geller: </b>There&#146;s nothing to discuss. We&#146;re not paying for your wine
cellar.</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham: </b>(Pleading.) You-you have to meet me in the middle here.</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Geller: </b>(Forcefully.) Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet
the middle of your ass.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross: </b>Dad!! (Emily comes running in.)</p>
<b>

<p>Emily: </b>What-what&#146;s going on?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross: </b>Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham: </b>You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? (Pointing at
Jack and poking him) You want a piece of me?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross: </b>(Stepping in between them.)Okay! Okay! That&#146;s it!! Parents!! Parents!!
Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! &nbsp; From now on everyone gets along,
and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! (Pointing at his mother.) That&#146;s
right!!</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Geller: </b>Okay, okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham: </b>Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. (Them all walk away. As he leaves
he mutters to Jack.) I could kill you with my thumb, you know.</p>
<b>

<p>Emily: </b>What was all that about?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross: </b>(Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in
her wedding dress.) My god. You...you look beautiful.</p>
<b>

<p>Emily: </b>(Giggles.) Ohh...(She realizes that she&#146;s in her gown.) Oh! You were
not meant to see me before the wedding. It&#146;s bad luck.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross: </b>You know what, I think we&#146;ve had all the bad luck we&#146;re going to
have. (He hugs her.)</p>

<p>(The front entrance. Joey and the bridesmaid are up against the wall kissing. Rachel
comes in the door and walks by Joey unnoticed. She walks into the chapel and sees Ross and
Emily kissing. She looks as though she wants to cry. Emily walks away and Ross turns and
sees Rachel standing there.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross: </b>My God. Rachel! (He walks towards her, grasps her hands and kisses her on the
cheek.) Your here. I can&#146;t believe it. (She giggles.) What happen? Why are you here?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel: </b>Well I just came...(She touches him near his heart. She&#146;s almost in
tears.) I just needed to tell you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.)
Congratulations. (He hugs her. She can barely hold back the tears.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Camera fades to one of the band members playing guitar at the wedding. The
chapel is full of guest. A groomsmen escorts a bridesmaid down the isle. Joey is waiting
with Mrs. Waltham to escort he down the isle. A cellular phone rings.]</p>

<p>Mrs. Waltham: </b>(Answering the phone.) Hello, Waltham Interiors.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It&#146;s Phoebe again.</p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Waltham: </b>(Throws her head back in disgust.) Why?!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is
going to be the last time I promise.</p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Waltham: </b>(Slapping the phone into Joey&#146;s chest.) Joey there&#146;s a girl
on the phone for you.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>(Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to
escort her down the aisle.)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Did you stop Rachel?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>No, but it&#146;s okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>So nothing got ruined?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>No.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>Oh that&#146;s so great! Ohh, so what&#146;s going on now?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey: </b>Ah, I&#146;m-I&#146;m walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham
takes her place.) I&#146;m about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night.
(Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her &quot;Hey.&quot; And now
I&#146;m at the front with Ross. It&#146;s Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks
pretty mad. Uh...I&#146;d better go.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe: </b>No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks
at Ross and holds the phone above Ross&#146;s shoulder.)</p>

<p>(Chandler escorts Monica down the aisle.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler: </b>What we did last night was....</p>
<b>

<p>Monica: </b>Stupid.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler: </b>Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)</p>
<b>

<p>Monica: </b>What were we thinking?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler: </b>I&#146;m coming over tonight though, right?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica: </b>Oh yeah. Definitely.</p>

<p>(They quickly take their places and Here Comes the Bride Begins to play. Everyone
seated looks back. Emily is being escorted up the aisle by her father. She kisses him on
the cheek and takes her place by Ross&#146;s side.)</p>

<p>Minister: </b>(Looking and feeling awkward. he looks towards Emily.) Uhh...Shall I go

<p>(Rachel looks all around as if all the eyes in the chapel were looking at her as the
picture fades to black.)</p>
