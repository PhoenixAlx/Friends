<p>[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is showing Ross, Rachel, Joey, and
Phoebe his engagement ring again.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah? Well, you should know. You&#146;ve bought like a billion of
&#145;em.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, you didn&#146;t get one.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, well tonight&#146;s the big night.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.
I&#146;m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows
how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I&#146;m
just gonna propose.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That sounds perfect!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You&#146;re gonna mess it up let me do it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m not gonna mess it up.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> If she says no, can I have the ring?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She&#146;s not gonna say no.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <b>If</b>!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p>(Monica&#146;s entrance makes Phoebe try to hide the ring by putting it in her mouth.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (with her mouthful) Hi Monica.</p>

<p>(Monica goes into her room.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Phoebe) Give me it!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&#146;s gone.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe!</p>

<p>(She takes it out of her mouth and hands it to him as Monica returns from her room and
this time forcing Chandler to put the ring in his mouth.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (with his mouthful) Hi Monica.</p>

<p>(She goes into the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Chandler) We&#146;re practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and
winks at him.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey are there as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Rach!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event
for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica?
Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler can&#146;t go. We&#146;re
going to dinner remember?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What&#146;s the big deal?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I just get mad when Rachel doesn&#146;t remember where we&#146;re
going.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Where are you going?</p>

<p>(Chandler stares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Open bar?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can do that for the kids.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, y&#146;know what? I&#146;ll come too. I&#146;m making money now;
it&#146;s about time I give something back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Have a benefit.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so you&#146;re already doing your part for the kids.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s just one of my last nights together before she
leaves for camp&#151;to be a counselor!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this
relationship going?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn&#146;t agree to that!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you really see this as a long-term thing?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&#146;know, you are 12 years older than her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-uh&#151;Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had
no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age
difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it
doesn&#146;t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I&#146;m the one dating
Elizabeth, not you!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> See? Now, he could date her.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is practicing proposing.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Will you marry me? <b>Will</b> you marry me? (Makes like a gun with
his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in
all excited.) What&#146;s going on little elves?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah you have the ring?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes
over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a
surprise and she&#146;s gonna know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!</p>

<p>(Monica enters from the bedroom.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi guys.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) You are beautiful.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears
knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (breaking up) We&#146;re just really&#133;very excited about this
charity event that we have to go to.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Charity Event, they&#146;re holding a silent auction, Rachel is looking at
one of the items and Phoebe walks up and hands her a glass of wine.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Thank you!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So now what&#146;s going on here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here
and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I know what a silent is I meant, what&#146;s going on with your
hair?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! It&#146;s nice!</p>

<p>(Rachel&#146;s boss, Mr. Thompson walks up.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> Nice to see you Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> So glad you brought someone.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is
Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He&#146;s the head of my department.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And I also brought my friend Joey&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his
way for the shrimp toast.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y&#146;know I-I don&#146;t know where he is.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> Well, I hope you&#146;re gonna bid on some things Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y&#146;know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip
to Paris.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> Ohh, nice choice.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> Good luck.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after he&#146;s left.) Okay,
(writing her bid down) twenty dollars.</p>

<p>[Scene: Elizabeth&#146;s Dorm Room, Ross is walking up to her door and knocks on it.
Suddenly the door opens and Elizabeth drags him into the room.]</p>

<p>{Transcriber&#146;s Note: Elizabeth has two friends in the room with her who are named
in the credits, but not in this scene. So I&#146;m just gonna guess since it doesn&#146;t
matter one way or the other. (The last part is to discourage e-mails, who cares if I got
it right or not?)}</p>

<p><b>Zoe:</b> Shut the door! Shut the door!! (Runs over and closes the door.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s-what&#146;s going on?</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you have to call the police! That&#146;s what I did to the kids in my
building!</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> No, it&#146;s a water balloon fight! We started it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you
wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it&#146;s supposed to be excellent. The director is
the same&#133;</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> (ignoring him and picking up a pitcher) Who drank all the Kamikazes? </p>

<p><b>Sarah:</b> (approaching with two filled balloons in her hands) Nobody! We put them
in here! (Indicates the aforementioned balloons causing both of them to scream in delight
and start drinking from the balloons.)</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> (To Ross) You want some?! (Starts to squirt the Kamikaze at him.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to
you for a second?</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It&#146;s-it&#146;s gotten great
reviews! Y&#146;know the uh&#133;</p>

<p>(Suddenly the door opens and two guys come rushing in wielding water balloons.)</p>

<p><b>First Dorm Guy:</b> Attack! </p>

<p>(They start lobbing the balloons in. Ross desperately tries to get out of the line of
fire but is struck in the back. The girls all retreat to relative safety behind the
couch.)</p>

<p><b>Second Dorm Guy:</b> Put your balloons down!</p>
<b>

<p>The Girls:</b> You put your balloons down!!</p>

<p><b>First Dorm Guy:</b> You put your balloons down!!</p>

<p>(Both opposing camps start screaming at each other to drop their weapons and surrender.
Finally, Ross steps in as a mediator.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (screaming) Everybody <b>put</b> their balloons <b>down</b>!!! (There is a
temporary cease fire.) Now this is a <b>nice</b> suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The Charity Event, Mr. Thompson is announcing the winners of the silent
auction.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. (Pause.)</p>

<p> It goes to
Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh! So close!</p>

<p>(Phoebe returns a with a tray full of different kinds of drinks.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey you guys! Look! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I got me some drinks!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Open bar!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well now it&#146;s an empty bar.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You just can&#146;t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can&#146;t
you?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot
gentleman&#146;s day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! (Joey
suddenly gets excited.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I won! That was my guess!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! What?! What?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I guessed 20,000!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey! It is an auction! You don&#146;t guess, you buy!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! I don&#146;t have 20,000!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!</p>

<p>(Everyone applauds and he stands up slowly.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts </p>

<p>applauding</p>

<p>again. Joey waves and does a salute.] </p>

<p>[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are sitting at a table. Monica is checking
pockets until he finds what he&#146;s looking for and sighs in relief.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart)</p>

<p> One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all.</p>

<p> (Laughs.) I remembered it. The champagne is here. </p>

<p>(The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! Yes! I&#146;m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is
everything&#151;are you&#151;are you perrr-perfect?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. I&#146;m okay. I&#146;m actually&#151;I&#146;m a little cold, can
I have your jacket?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you
can&#146;t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were
going to be cold, you should&#146;ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are
you okay? Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) Are you sure you&#146;re okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! I&#146;m fine. In fact I&#146;ve been fine for a long time now
and I think, the reason is you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh that&#146;s sweet!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I
couldn&#146;t imagine growing old with&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting him) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know,</p>

<p> but just let me say it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard&#146;s back.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?! I&#146;m Chandler! (She nods towards the</p>

<p> doorway, Chandler
turns and looks) Oh, that&#146;s Richard!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God, maybe he won&#146;t see us. Richard!</p>

<p>(Monica smiles then acts shocked. Chandler can&#146;t believe she just did that.)</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> (approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don&#146;t know why I did
that!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah&#151;Oh that&#146;s right. You, you always </p>

<p>wanted me to. Hey, I
see you got your mustache back.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Well, my nose got lonely.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Richard&#146;s date) And uh, you don&#146;t</p>

<p> have a mustache which
is good. (She just smiles.) I&#146;m Chandler; I make jokes when </p>

<p>I&#146;m uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Richard&#146;s Date:</b> Hi, I&#146;m Lisa.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh, I&#146;m sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa,</p>

<p> (nodding at each) Monica,
Chandler. We used to date.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Richard! No one supposed to know about us! </p>

<p>(Richard just smiles at
him.) See I, did it again.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, wh-why don&#146;t we sit down?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I&#146;ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Richard) It&#146;s good to see you</p>

<p><b>Matire'd:</b> (to Richard) You&#146;re table&#146;s ready sir.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh. Good to see you guys.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. (Thinking he&#146;s gone.)</p>

<p><b>Matire'd:</b> (motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandler&#146;s) Or
if you prefer, this table is available.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> <b>What</b> were you thinking?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I didn&#146;t know it was an auction!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wh?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why would a charity give away a free boat?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know! Charity?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, just buy the damn boat! (She&#146;s still working her way through
her tray of booze.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, don&#146;t you think you&#146;ve had enough to drink?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m just helping the kids!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> How is you drinking helping the kids?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> (approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh hi!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building
the youth center.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Thompson:</b> I think it was valued at 19,000</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad
news. Umm, I can&#146;t buy the boat, I don&#146;t have any money.</p>

<p>(Mr. Thompson looks shocked and at Rachel, she suddenly starts laughing.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So uh listen, I think I&#146;m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stopping him) Hey! You&#133;can&#146;t&#133;leave Joey! You agreed to
buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna
kill me!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don&#146;t have that kind of money!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All
right, this is what we&#146;re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and
we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you&#146;re just gonna pay the difference.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I don&#146;t know why the kids need a youth center anyway!

at it right on the bathroom floor.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my
parents making love to the same guy.</p>

<p>(An awkward silence ensues.)</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> It&#146;s so great seeing you guys again. I&#146;d like to make a
toast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, &quot;In the sweetness of
friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things
the heart finds it&#146;s morning and is refreshed.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God, you guys!! (He&#146;s excited about what he thought happened.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we
got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Who?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Richard!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that&#146;s right that&#146;s
right. That&#146;s Richard&#146;s favorite place too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh you knew that. Good!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can&#146;t get
out of!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&#146;know, maybe she is too young for me. Y&#146;know, when I was over
there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I
finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don&#146;t know what to do.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why don&#146;t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship
against the bad stuff. I mean that&#146;s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and
pauses) weighing stuff.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I&#146;m-I&#146;m 12 years older than she is.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> If the school finds out you&#146;re fired.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p>(Chandler puts his face in his hands as Joey and Phoebe start to examine the trash.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eww! Oh, it&#146;s all dirty. You should throw this out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe&#146;s wishes.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn&#146;t know for sure,
so just throw her off the track.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage
is the last thing on my mind.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you&#146;re scared of commitment!
Convince her that you&#146;re a little coward!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can do that, I&#146;ve had 30 years of practice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)</p>

her and we can hear his thoughts.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (in his head) <i>Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was
such a grown-up about it! She didn&#146;t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge
mistake?</p>
</i>

<p><b>Elizabeth:</b> (sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about&#133;</p>

look? Do I look like a guy who doesn&#146;t want to get married?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each
other.) I never noticed that before.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, just hanging out, talkin&#146; about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it
is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well that&#146;s a little crazy. Although I am y&#146;know glad to hear
that you&#146;re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well&#133; Y&#146;know, it just got me thinking though, why
would anybody ever want to get married huh?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To
declare your love for one another to the world!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay well that&#146;s good to know.</p>
