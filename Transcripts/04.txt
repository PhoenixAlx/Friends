Mother
Rachel: You mean the mom you met in Montauk She was a cat?!
Phoebe: No, no-no, she was a human lady This is the spirit of my Mom
Lily, the one who killed herself
Ross: Are you sure shes in the cat, or have you been taking your
grandmas glycoma medicine again?
Phoebe: No Dr Skeptismo! Im sure First of all, okay, theres the
feeling  Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my
guitar case which is lined with orange felt  My
Mothers favourite fish is Orange Roughy 
 Catslikefish!  
 Hi, Mommy  Oh, I

what he did to me!
Monica: What, that little thing at the prom?
Rachel: Monica! I couldnt find him for two hours! He was having sex with
Amy Welch!
Monica: Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Rachel: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Monica: Look, you and I went to different high schools
Rachel: Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high
school
Monica: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off
Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket I went to one where I wore a band
uniform they had to have specially made
Rachel:  They had to have that specially made?!
Monica: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes
Rachel:  Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Monica: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out
with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out And the
fat girl inside of me really wants to go I-I owe her this I never let her eat
Rachel: Oh, you go out with him  
Monica: Oh, really?!
Rachel: Yeah Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go
have sex with another guy?
Monica: Ill try
Ross: So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Joey: Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think
any of them are gonna work out
Chandler: Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process Apparently, not
everyone is qualified to own wood and nails
Phoebe:  Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,
trying to get away! Just like when she was alive
Ross: So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Phoebe: Well, Im not sure I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to
the fact that theres y'know, a new mom Y'know, I think shes worried that
y'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced 
Well, thats not gonna happen is it? Noo  Okay, I have to return a call in
the other room
Monica: Why cant you use the phone in here?
Phoebe: Well, Im returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H I
just spelled the wrong word 
Ross: So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat?
Monica: Ross, dont start
Ross: Come on, you-you cant tell me you actually believe that-that
theres a woman inside that cat!
Rachel: I believe it
Ross: No you dont 
Rachel: Yes, I do
Ross: No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this
Rachel: Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right
Ross: I do not always have to beokay, okay 
Rachel: Jurassic Park could happen
Tony: Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
Joey: Pretty nice?
Chandler: Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this
Tony: We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it?
Weve got a canoe
Chandler: Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe
Tony: You gotta take the canoe!
Chandler: All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you
get home, throw the canoe away!
Peter: Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe! 
Joey:  Good for you!!
Rachel:  You guys, youre never gonna believe what I just found
tacked up on a telephone pole!  Look kinda familiar?
Ross:  Apparently Phoebes mother also goes by the name
Julio
Rachel: You guys, theres a little girl in Soho looking for this cat I
mean, you know what that means?!
Joey:  Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Rachel: Do we have to tell her?

think big enough to fit a grown man!
Chandler: SoYou got in voluntarily?!
Joey: I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy

Chandler: BEND OVER?!!!
Chip: and then Zana, just let one rip!! 
Monica: Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school
with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I
dont even know where you work?
Chip: You know where I work!
Monica: I do?
Chip: The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time
Monica: You still work at the multiplex?
Chip: Oh, like Id give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I
want I can get you free posters for your room
Monica: Thanks, Im set Do you still live with your parents?
Chip: Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want
Rachel: Wow! They really got you guys Your TV The chairs
Phoebe: Oh yeah, your microwave The stereo
Joey:  Aww, man, he took the five of spades!!
Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Monica:  Oh my God! What happened?
Chandler: Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Rachel:  So, how was your date?
Monica: Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high
school?
Rachel: Um-hmm
Monica: Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school
Rachel: Oh honey, Im sorry
Monica: No, its okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I
got to dump Chip Matthews
Rachel: Ohh! Thats so great!
Monica: I know!
Ross:  Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Chandler: Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop
calling us
Ross:  You didnt tell her?! 
 Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Phoebe: Yeah?  Hi!
Ross: Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl There are flyers all
over the place
Rachel: Im sorry, sweetie 
Monica: Hey, we can take her back with you if you want
Phoebe: Ohh Um-hmm But y'know, she choose to find me I mean, I have to
respect her decision Right?
Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel: Thats a good call Right
Ross: No! No! LookHey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel
guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom
This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Phoebe:  Ross,
how many parents have you lost?
Ross: None
Phoebe: Okay, then you dont know what it feels like when one of them comes
back Do you? I believe this is my Mother Even if Im wrong, who cares? Just be a
friend Okay? Be supportive
Ross: Im sorry
Phoebe: Okay
Ross: I dont know what to say
Rachel: You could say youre sorry to her mom
Phoebe: I think she would like that
Ross:  Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs
Buffay Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you
were just a cat When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friends
mother
Phoebe: Thank you We both forgive you
Rachel: So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Phoebe: Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to
me And youre welcome to come back anytime
Chandler: Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate
it 
Phoebe: Come on, Mom, Ill take you home
Rachel: Ill go with you
Monica: Me too 
Ross: Oh! Y'know, Ive got an extra futon
Joey: Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!
for the canoe Joey is sitting in the bow, staring off into space as to envision his
future full of possibilities Chandler is sitting at the stern, staring into space and is
s04e03
Joey: Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we
could have all this cool stuff from the basement Wait right there 
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, Im, Im paddling away!
Joey:  Huh?!
Chandler: Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Joey: Uh-huh This and a bunch of bubble wrap And,
some of it is not even popped! 
Chandler: Could we be more white trash?
Monica:  How desperate am I?
Rachel: Oh! Good thing Chandlers not here, he always wins at
this game
Monica: I just told my Mom Id cater a party for her
Phoebe: How come?
Monica: Because I need the money, and I thought that itd be a
great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect
Ross: Come on, I think this is a good thing I dont think Mom
wouldve hired you if she didnt think you were good at what you do
Monica: You dont have to stick up for her She cant here
you
Rachel:  Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Joey: Just pickle
Chandler: Hey uh, Rach, funny story I ah, bumped into Joanna on the
street yesterday
Rachel: My boss, Joanna? Wow, that mustve been awkward
Chandler: Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a
drink
Rachel:  You ah, you didnt say Yes to that
did you?
Chandler:  No No!
Joanna:  Hello,
Rachel 
Chandler: Well, not at first
Rachel: What is she doing here?
Rachel: I dont understand! Last time you went out with her you
said she was a big, dull dud
Chandler: Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we
were able to take the relationship to the next level
Rachel: Well, last time I almost got fired You must end it, you must
Chandler: Oh, come on! Its not like this is an everyday
occurrence for me! I mean usually Im pretty much just in there by myself
Rachel: Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end
it
Chandler: Okay, I promise, Ill end it
Rachel: Thank you
Chandler: I hope you know what Im giving up for ya, because
shes not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean
Joey: Yeah-eh-eah!  Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what
he meant
Mrs Geller:  Hows the hired help?
Monica: Doing great, the quiches are coming along
Mrs Geller: Whats this? Blue nail polish?
Monica: Yeah, I thought it was cute
Mrs Geller: Ahh, thats what your Grandmothers hands
looked like when we found her
Monica: Let me ask you a question
Mrs Geller: Hmm
Monica: Why did you hire me?
Mrs Geller: Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of
course you were sleeping with him Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very
nice, I assume you werent sleeping with anybody there Though, at least that would
be something 
Monica:  Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because
she thinks Im good
Phoebe: Okay, I didnt hear that
Monica: Oh yeah, she didnt hire me out of pity, it wasnt
so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks Im good
Phoebe: Wow! And hey, its cool if youre a lesbian! 
The Salesman:  Good afternoon,
are you the decision maker of the house?
Joey: Uhhhh 
The Salesman: Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? 
Joey: No! No But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in
there
The Salesman: Actually, Im not buying Im selling Let me
ask you one question Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even
though youre not really sure what theyre talking about?
Ross: Im telling you its totally unconstituional
Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel: Oh yeah, I totally agree
Monica: I think he deserves a Nobel Prize 
All: Nooo!! 
Chandler: it was like the Algonquin kids table 
The Salesman:  Excuse me, Im sorry,
you havent said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all
interested?
Joey: Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah Come on in
Phoebe: Thats weird
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Your nails
Monica: Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones I just did it so my Mom
wouldnt give me grief about me biting them
Phoebe: Oh, no, I meant that its weird that you only have nine
now
Monica:  Oh my God Wait a minute, I had them
put  Oh my God! Its in the quiche! Oh My God!
Phoebe: Okay, dont panic Im gonna go to the store,
Im gonna get you another set of nails, no ones gonna know, and youre
gonna look great  Oh! Oh, its cause
theyre gonna eatthats the problem
Mrs Geller:   Honey, dont bite your nails
Monica: Okay ah, please dont freak out Umm, but ah,
theres a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and theres no way to know
which one
Phoebe: And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Mrs Geller:  Im not freaking out
Monica: Then why are you laughing?
Mrs Geller: Its nothing, its just that now your Father
owes me five dollars
Monica: What? You bet Id lose a nail?
Mrs Geller: Oh no, dont be silly I just bet Id need
these 
Monica: Frozen lasagnas?
Mrs Geller: Um-hmm
Monica: You bet that Id screw up?! So all that stuff about
hiring me because I was good was
Mrs Geller: No-no-no, that was all true This was just in case you
pulled a Monica
Monica: You promised Dr Weinburg, youd never use that phrase
Mrs Geller: Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, youve
never been able to laugh at yourself
Monica:  Thats right My Mom doesnt have any faith
in me! Oh, thats hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Phoebe: I dont get it
Mrs Geller: No, I have faith
Monica:  No! You have lasagnas! 
Oven: Ding!
Phoebe: Op, the ruined quiches are ready
Chandler: It just doesntfeel like were breaking up

 theres pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Joanna:  Oh
Sophie: Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Joanna: Oh great! Ill keep it in my butt with your nose 
Rachel: Thats weird, she locked the door
Sophie: Yknow why? Shes got the Christmas bonus list in

Rachel: You promised you would break up with her!
Chandler: I did break up with her! She just took it really, really
well!
Rachel: And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never
entered your mind?!
Chandler: It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made
it, shoot right out
Rachel: Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you
get yourself out of them
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I cant get myself right out of
them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock
me, she could be gone for hours, and Im cold, and

handcuffs taken off them  Hello sweet pants!
Rachel: Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Chandler: About what?
Rachel: When she sees that youre gone, shes gonna know
that I let you out, and that I was in here, and Im gonna get fired!
Chandler: Ill make something up! Im good at lying, I
actually did borrow your Walkman!

that I have a key to her office, Ive got to get you locked up back the way you were!

to do, and well call that pulling a Monica
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight As, his parents would
say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,
"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer
says, "Yeah, that ones outta here" Though some things dont change
Monica:  All right, Ill go down there But, Im
not gonna serve the lasagna Im gonna serve something I make

pizza Daddy, buy me a candy factory Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy
Birthday to me"
Rachel: I didnt I never said that
Mr Treeger:: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will
come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why dont think of someone else for a
change?
Rachel:  Okay, Im sorry 
Monica: God! If youre gonna cry about it! 
Joey: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?

forget about it
Rachel: Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed
Joey: All right thats it, school is in session! 
Monica:  My God! Is this a gym
card?
Chandler: Oh yeah, gym member I try to go four times a week, but Ive
missed the last 1200 times
Ross: So why dont you quit?
Chandler: You dont think Ive tried? You think I like having
50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down
there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they
bring out Maria
Ross: Who is Maria?
Chandler: Oh Maria You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra
spandex covered gymtreat
Ross: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?

Mr Treeger:: Tribbiani! Hold on, Ill get the plunger
Joey: Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry So now,

landlord
Mr Treeger:: And tell him what?
Joey: Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry
Mr Treeger:: Yeah Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act
of 1968!
Joey: I have actually not heard of that
Mr Treeger:: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it Ive been a
nice guy up until now, but uh, I dont need this grief Im gonna call the
landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmothers
apartment Your friends are outta here pal
Joey: Why dont you tell me something I dont know! 
Phoebe: Oh please, somebody tell me I dont have to go to work today!

time I see him I just want to do things to him that Im not allowed to charge for

around with clients And its against my oath as a masseuse
Ross: They make you take an oath?
Phoebe: No, I made myself take an oath Yeah, no fooling around with clients and

Phoebe: No, I can handle it No, Im a professional 
Rachel: Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Monica: Wow! And you got a petticure Your feet are all dressed up

Phoebe: Because its Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Rachel: Oh! My hero! What happened?
Joey: Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like
that and that hed better come up here and apologize Ill see you later
Monica: What a minute, what did he say?
Joey: He said that he wasnt gonna apologize because you guys are living
here illegally, so instead what hes gonna do is have you evictedIll see
you later
Rachel: What?! You got us evicted!!
Monica: I told you not to go down there!
Joey: Well he made Rachel cry!
Monica: Rachel always cries!
Rachel: Thats not true! 
Monica: Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him I mean you suck like

and I until you get settled
Rachel: Go!!

cool with it

Joey: It's two gifts in one It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? 
Chandler: Huh-huh! You can't give her that 
Joey: Why not? 
Chandler: Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah! 
Rachel: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is while this is a very nice gift,
maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? 
Joey: Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over
"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!" 
Chandler: All right, look, look What did what did you get for Angela Delveccio

looked giant

funeral was? 
Monica: What? 
Phoebe: Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some
people who just always try to get out of paying It's either, you know, "that massage
wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know,
"these sombreros aren't big enough Bad little white girl!" 
Monica: Okay So what do you you think she's faking? 
Phoebe: Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill 
Monica: Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me 
Mrs Burkart:  You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and
forever in peace may you wave 
Phoebe: She seems fine now 
Mrs Burkart:  emblem of the land I love The home of

Ross: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? 
Joey: Yeah 
Ross: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage And instead
of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of
time, and garbage is all that has survived!

Joey: Wow Thanks So, uh, what happened? 
Ross: What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there

for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit 
Rachel: Any luck? 
Chandler: Oh, yeah Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things
for Kathy"  Can you give me a
hand with all this stuff? 
Rachel: All right, look Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the
clock pen, and you give her something worse than that Like a regular pen

to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her

naked! It was like torture!
Ross: Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a
big surprise
Chandler: It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean its bad
enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think
she knows Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like
energy between us And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too And now I have seen
her naked I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her
body was like covered in boles or something But there are no boles, shes smooth!
Smooth! 
Phoebe: Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
All: Yeah! Oh my God!
Casey: Here you go
Joey: Great! All right, so Ill call you later

Joey: No, things are fine with Kathy Im having a late dinner with her
tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey
Chandler:  What?
Joey: Yeah-yeah And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by
myself! 
Chandler: Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
Joey: Yeah Why are you getting so upset?
Chandler: Well, Im upsetfor you I mean, having sex with an endless
line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you 
Joey: What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive
Chandler: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs But
Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that
shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you
Joey: You got all that from the back of her head?
Chandler: All right look, I think its time for you to settle down Y'know?
Make a choice, pick a lane
Joey: Whos Elaine?
Phoebe:  "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease" Darn it! Now, I dont know who to
get to the next verse
Ross: Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease 
 BAH-bah-bha-bhannn" Then go right into it
Phoebe: Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah Wait! How do you know about
bah-bah-bha-bhan?
Ross: Well umm, yknow, I used to play
Phoebe: Oh yeah, thats right, the keyboards, huh?
Ross: Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in
college I mean thats-thats when I really found my sound
Monica: Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth
it Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound
Ross: Yeah
Monica: He used to lock himself in the basement for hours No one was every
allowed to hear, "The Sound"
Phoebe: I wanna hear "The Sound"

okay 
Ross: Okay, guys
Chandler: All right! Bring it on, you
Ross: Here we go  Yknow, Ive-Ive never played
my stuff for anyone before, so its important that-that you understand its
about communicating very private emotions  Yknow, umm, you
should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems Thats what
Im
Chandler:  Oh my God! Play!
the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam,
someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes,
Monica:  Boy, that was-that was, umm terrific

Joey:  A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream!
Man, how did you afford this stuff?

Phoebe: Well, kinda Yeah Yeah
Ross: Pheebs
Phoebe: Yeah, I-I cantI mean yknow I was trying to be really
y'know okay and upbeat about it, I justI feel so dwarfed by your musical gift
I
Ross: See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music
Yknow my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I
I wont play anymore
Phoebe: Oh no No-no-no, dont do that! How could I live with myself if I
knew I was depriving the world of your music

Chandler: I kissed Kathy
Ross: What?
Monica: Are you serious?
Phoebe: Does Joey know?
Chandler: No Is there anyway, anyway you think hell
understand this?
Monica: You obviously havent screwed over a lot of your friends 
 Which we all appreciate
Ross: No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you
kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside
Chandler: Oh, dont say that! Dont say that Thats not true Is
it?
Phoebe: I think maybe, yeah
Monica: He loves you
Chandler: Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!
Ross: Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe
Phoebe: Yeah! No, thats right And I thought it was a really good idea
Rachel: I know, I remember that!
Monica: I remember you did
Chandler: God!!  What am I gonna do?!
Rachel: Well, Chandler, youre gonna have to tell him
Chandler: Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Rachel: Because you do
Chandler: Yeah, I know
Ross: Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
Chandler: Is that a real thing?
Joey: Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now
Chandler: Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something
Joey: Whats up?
Chandler: Its-its about Kathy Umm, uh, I like her I like her a lot
actually
Joey: You do?
Chandler: Yeah
Joey: Well, youre timing couldnt be better Shes not my
girlfriend anymore
Chandler: What?
Joey: Yeah, she broke up with me
Chandler: Oh uh, when?
Joey: Just now, after acting class At first I thought she was doing some kind
of scene, thats why I let people watch
Chandler: Oh man, I am so sorry Are, are you okay?
Joey: Well, Ive been better But, Im all right So you like her huh?
Chandler: Yes, but I-I uh, dont have too
Joey: No-no-no, no its uh, its okay
Chandler: Yeah?
Joey: Yeah You know why? Cause you came to me first
Chandler: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do
Joey: But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out
for you Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes into
some other guy So
Chandler: See uh, thats-thats actually what I wanted to talk to you
about I-I think I know who the other guy is
Joey: Who?
Chandler: Its me Im the other guy
Joey: What?
Chandler: Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to
talking, and one thing to another and
Joey: And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Chandler: No! No! No! I just kissed her
Joey: What?!! Thats even worse!!
Chandler: How is that worse?!
Joey: I dont know! But its the same!
Chandler: Look, Im sorry! But theres nothing I can do, I think
Im in love with her!
Joey: Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Chandler: Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line
Joey: Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that
you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Chandler: Yes Yes! Right! And I feel horrible You have to believe me!
Joey: Is that why you bought all this stuff?! 
 Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not
listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that
Im not gonna eat! You know why?!
Chandler: Probably because
Joey: Because its all tainted with your betrayal From now on this
apartment is empty for me! And Im not happy about you either 
 Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you 
Phoebe: Oh my God, hes lost it Hes totally lost it
Monica:  What?
Rachel: Phoebe, his music could not get any worse There are
rats in the basement that are hanging themselves
Ross: Thank you, thanks  Yeah, I lost it
Yknow, Im not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my
set?
Phoebe: After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help
Ross: Yeah, like I could lose it
Rachel: What?
Ross: I played bad on purpose guys
Monica: Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time
Ross: Yeahno, just that last song
s04e08
Joey:  Hello
Chandler:  Hey, its me I know you cant stand to be in the
same room as me, so I just thought Id try and apologize over the phone All I
Joey:  Hello
Chandler: Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but Im
Joey:  Stop callin!!
Voice:  Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 923, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily
challenge
Joey: All right!
Voice: What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do
anything 
Chandler:  Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Phoebe: Look everyone, its the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Rachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?
Chandler: They couldnt be worse I spent eight hours calling him last
night, just trying to get him to talk to me
Rachel: Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those
plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Ross: Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen
from your office?
Rachel: You shouldnt
Phoebe: Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new
business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then
we each only buy one gift And-and theres the added mystery of who gets who
Ross: Who gets whom  I dont know why I do that
Rachel: Well, Im gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy
Monica: We havent eaten yet!
Rachel: I know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, I
just 
Chandler: Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,
cause I wanna trade for her
Phoebe: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Chandler: Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Phoebe: Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like
impossible to get her something she likes Come on, lets trade!
Chandler: Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpack
and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off
with it  Oh, there was no big
dog All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had RG put on
it  Her initials
Phoebe: Ohh
Monica: Well, maybe you could give to somebody else Ooh, like Ross Geller
Chandler: Op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase
Monica: Who cares? He works in a museum!
Chandler: Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Phoebe: You dont have to do that, Ross and Joey arent here, you can
watch the parade if you want
Chandler: Thanks
Monica: What is wrong with this freezer?! 
 Ow! Ow!!
Phoebe: God, what happened?!
Monica: Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Rachel:  People are trying to sleep in here!
Chandler: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts
Phoebe: Open it up, let me see
Monica: Oh, yknow what, I cant, it really kills
Chandler: Well maybe you should put some ice on it
Phoebe: Ooh, God it looks bad
Rachel: Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor
Monica: No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont
have a boyfriend!
Chandler: Hes really picky about his patients
Phoebe: Honey, youve got to go Whats his office number?
Monica: Like I remember his office number!  Speed dial 7
Phoebe:  Hi! Yeah, Im calling on behalf of Monica Gellers
eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today   Hes out of town,
but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Monica: Yes!!
Phoebe: Yes! Shes very excited about that
Phoebe: This is so cool, til Monica gets back, its like Im
head chef and I get to make all the decisions 
Ross: Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Phoebe: Okay, get out of my kitchen!
Chandler:  All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with
Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed
the door once!  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it
Phoebe: All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking
question
Ross: So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Im already
getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch
Chandler: Oh yknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you
Ross: Really?! Wow! Thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Chandler: I dont know RG, I was thinking something girlie for your
office
Ross: Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna
get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets
Ross: Oh, thats not true! Ive got her lots of stuff she never took
back
Chandler: Like?
Ross: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year
Chandler: When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Ross: Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
Chandler: Big dog?
Ross:  Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: What are you doing?
Joey: Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt
Ross: Everything? Even the TV?
Joey: No! Im putting that in my room
Ross: Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but dont you think you
could at least hear the guy out?
Joey: Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would
you hear him out?
Ross: Thats a good point So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Joey: Five years 
Ross: Youve sentenced him?!
Joey: Hey! Dont do the crime if you cant do the time
Ross: Joey, the guys your best friend
Joey: No, was my best friend Anyway, I dont know why
youre pushing for him so hard With him out of the way as my best friend,
theres a spot open
Ross: Oh, who? Me?
Joey: Yeah!
Ross: Wow! Im honored! And yknow what Im gonna do as my first
act as your best friend?
Joey: What?
Ross: Im gonna get you to talk to Chandler
Joey: All right But if you werent my best friend
Kathy: Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Chandler: I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles
something in Italian And I know he only knows the bad words
Joey:  Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Gunther: I thought you were Chandler But umm, one of who is over
there
Kathy: Oh
Chandler: Hey Joe
Joey:  
Doctor: Ill be right with you Okay?  Thanks, Wendy
Monica: Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Rachel: Ooh, so cute, that Im thinking about jamming this pen in my eye
Nurse: Dr Burke will see you know
Monica: Oh no-no-no, not Dr Burke Dr Burke is out of town The-the on-call
doctor will see me now
Nurse: Dr Richard Burke is out of town Dr Timothy Burke, his son, will see
you now
Dr Timothy Burke: Ready?
Chandler: Hey! Im sorry! That
where are you going?
Joey: My folks
Chandler: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Joey: I dont know I might stay there for a few days while I look for an
apartment
Chandler: What?!
Joey: Yeah, yknow at first I thought we could talk about this yknow,
work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I
Chandler: Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that
Ill stop seeing her?
Joey: Look, its not about her Okay? But seeing you two together just
reminds me of what you did And I dont want to live with some one who doesnt
know what it is to be a friend So, Ill see ya 
Chandler: Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Joey: Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving
Chandler: All right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least
stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the
robbery and all!
Joey: When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about
how I let you down! 
Chandler: What?
Joey: Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn
out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!
Chandler: All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be
something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in
it for six hours and think about how I let you down  What?
Joey: Weve got a box 
Tim: Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college And you were
just standing outside The Dairy Queen
Monica: I was probably waiting for it to open
Tim: I gotta tell you, you look great now
Monica: You look great too
Tim: Youre an excellent patient!
Monica: So how does it look?
Tim: Well, youve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to
wear a patch for a couple of days
Monica: Like a pirate?!
Tim: If that helps you 
Monica: Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? 
Come on, one of us had to mention him
Tim: I moved back here a couple of months ago
Monica: Oh Big family dinner tonight?
Tim: Uh 
Monica: No way!
Tim: I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriends
Monica:  Oh
Tim: But we broke up
Monica:  Oh 
Tim: She-she wasnt ready for a serious commitment
Monica:  Oh  So you made her walk the
plank? Aye, matie?
Tim: Youre not wearing the patch yet
Monica: I know
Ross: Hes coming here for Thanksgiving!
Rachel: I know, its sick
Monica: Why is it sick?
Rachel: Because its Richards son! Its like inviting Greek
tragedy over for dinner!
Monica: Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand dont you?
Phoebe: Yeah, I can see where Id be your best shot but, no Im
sorry, but I think its twisted
Ross: Yeah
Joey:  Whats twisted?
Monica: Me going out with Richards son
Joey: Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Chandler:  Sounds like a really bad
idea to me
Rachel: Is he okay in there?
Joey: Hes fine!
Ross: Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richards son,
youd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather
Monica: Fine! Judge all you want to but,  married a lesbian,
 left a man at the altar,  fell in love with a gay ice
dancer,  threw a girls wooden leg in a fire, 
livin in a box!! 
Rachel: So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Joey: Chandler?
Chandler: The meaning of the box is three fold One 
, it gives me the time to think about what I did Two 
, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey And three 
, it hurts!
Ross:  Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last
year? Can I see it?
Rachel:  Why?
Ross: I just wanna check something
Rachel: Okay 
Ross:   Now, well
see
Chandler: Air hole! Air hole!! 
Rachel:  Here it is! I love it I
wear it all the time
Ross:  The necklace I got you was gold, this one is
silver
Rachel: Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed 
Ross: Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Rachel: Well isnt it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Ross: What did you get?
Rachel: Credit 
Monica:  Ill get it! Ill get it!
Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it! Ill get it!

and umm, you can use the fancy soap
Tim: Thank you
Rachel: Fancy soap? I thought we were savin that for the Pope!
Monica: See hes nice Right?
Phoebe: Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you
can actually use the phrase, "Thats not how your dad used to do it"
Tim: Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Monica: I saved you a seat 
Rachel:  Sick-sick-sick-sick
Phoebe: Oh, Ill get it 
Chandler: Gotcha! 
Joey: That doesnt sound like thinking to me!
Chandler: Sorry!
Joey: Yknow I dont think you should be talking at all in there! I
think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Chandler: Okay, okay, you got it!
Rachel: Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Ross: Sure! Oh, and Joeys got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange
them
Rachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Monica: Oh-ho-ho, weve got company
Ross: Theres nothing the matter with me See, Im not completely
devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings
Rachel: Okay, fine 
Chandler: You cant tell, but Im trying to break the tension by
mooning you guys!
Joey: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,
all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then
you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!
Chandler: Youre right, and Im sorry! This means a lot to me! I want
you to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight
Joey: So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Chandler: Absolutely!
Joey: That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?
 Okay
Rachel: Dont say that I have no sentiment! 
 This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell
from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the
museum from the first time we were together Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter! 
Ross: I dont know what to say, Im sorry Though, youre not
supposed to take these  Its like a million years old, we, we
actually, we had people looking for that
Monica:  Ooh, this always happens 
Tim: Here, let me help 
Monica: Thank you
Tim: You-you have a very beautiful eye
Monica: Yknow all my friends think this is weird 
Tim: Yknow I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and
canceled, but it really isnt
Monica: I know! I mean its like me and your dad, thats a totally
separate thing
Tim: Oh, I totally agree
Monica: Were just two people who find each other very attractive Right?
Tim: What?
Monica: Nothing Nothing
Tim: No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Monica: No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss

Monica: Yeah!
Tim: Oh man!!

Kathy: By being in a box?
Rachel: Joey, had reasons 
Phoebe: They were threefold
Kathy: Oh Well uh,  you not being able to talk may make
this easier Listen umm 
 Listen I dont wanna be someone who comes between two best

Rachel: Well, actually, I meant for me The hiring committee is meeting people
all day and
Joanna: Oh Well, I wish I could say no, but you cant stay my assistant
forever Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons

Rachel:  And thats Im so glad theres no
problem

to get that job Although, I might need some convincing
Rachel: Well, I, umm

I see here about implementing a new filing system

on all the folders?  It certainly did brighten up the inside of the
filing cabinets

cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers

Phoebe: Oh, okay!  "Would I go back to Allesandros? Sure,
but Id have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to
my head"  Wow! You really laid into this place
Monica: Hey, they dont pay me a penny a word to make friends
Phoebe: Ooh, I gotta go I found a guy that who could fix up the van for
catering
Monica: Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Phoebe: No-no, its okay But are we sure we dont want the waterbed?
Monica: Havent we made this decision?
Phoebe: Yeah, all right 
Monica: Bye!
Phoebe: Bye!
Monica:  Who is it?
Allesandro: Its Allesandro, from Allesandros
Monica: Oh my God
Allesandro: I want to talk to you about your review
Monica: Oh my God, oh my God  Call me on the phone!
Allesandro: Why? So you could hang up on me?
Monica: Look, I-Im never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away
Allesandro: Just give me a chance too
Phoebe:  Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go
Monica: No! Phoebe!
Phoebe: Hey, Monica!
Allesandro:  I want a retraction! Our food is not
inedible swill!
Monica: I couldnt eat it! I had five friends who couldnt eat it, and
one of them eats books
Allesandro: Well our service is not grossly incompetent
Monica: The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Allesandro: Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we
do not!
Monica: All right, that Ill retract But I stand by my review, I know food
and that wasnt it Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should
serve it with vodka and a piece of celery 
Allesandro: Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious
Monica: Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes
good?! Where are you even from?
Allesandro:  Lebanon
Monica: Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste
like! Come on, hand me them
Allesandro: How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go
yell at
Rachel:  Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that
interview
Joanna: I thought it went very well
Rachel: No! It didnt! Thats what I want to talk to you about
 Now, just to brief you  I may cry, but they are
not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you
Joanna: Rachel, please, dont make a scene
Rachel: Theres nobody here!
Joanna: Sophie, get in here!  You see! Now youre making
Sophie uncomfortable!
Sophie: Shes not making me uncomfortable
Joanna: Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless
Get out 
Rachel: Do you want me to quit?
Joanna: What?! What would make you think that?
Rachel: Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you
believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant Yknow what? I
am just gonna pack up my desk, 
 and I will be gone by the end of the day! 
 Well, I guess theres no use to me sticking around til the
Joanna: Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in
its drawer If you must know the truth, I didnt want to lose a perfectly good
assistant
Rachel: What?
Joanna: Thats why I said all those things about your flirting and your
drinking
Rachel: My drinking? 
Joanna: Oh, I mustve said that after you left
Rachel: Said what? Exactly
Joanna: That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge
Rachel: Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible
person!
Joanna: Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If youre gonna get all
sensitive about it! I dont want to lose you What if I, create a position for you?
Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department
Rachel: Say more things like that
Joanna: You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow
Rachel: Id need an expense account
Joanna: Done!
Rachel: And an assistant
Joanna: Sophie, get in here! 
Joey: Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought youd be out partying
with Gandel-worf
Ross: Its Gandolf, and hes not coming
Joey: So youve been sittin around here all mornin?
Ross: No! I balanced my checkbook 
Chandler: Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players
Ross: I cant believe he didnt come!
Joey: So what if he didnt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Chandler: Oh-no, yknow with Gandolf wed be out all
night!
Ross: Yeah! Wed meet, wed meet total strangers, and hang out with
them!
Joey: Well, we could do that! 
Ross: Theres other stuff too
Joey: Well do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want
to party with us, dude! Come on!
Ross: Yeah!
Joey: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah!!
Joey: Yeah!! 
Ross: Its not like we dont know how to party!!
Joey: Yeah! All right? Lets go!
Chandler: And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Joey and Ross: Yeah!!!
Chandler: All right!!
Ross:  Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Chandler: Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were
licking your face?
Ross: Yeah
Chandler: Well, those were seals, man
Rachel: Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on
an assistant buyer?
Monica: Okay, the owner of Allesandros came over to yell at me, but
instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Rachel: Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way
home, but Im soo happy!
Monica: Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Rachel: Ohh, youve waited soo long 
Phoebe:  Hey!
Rachel: Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya
Phoebe: Yeah
Rachel: How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdales?
Phoebe: I dont know, it would totally depend on her coloring and
 You got the job!!
Rachel: Yes!!!
Monica: You got the job?! Why didnt you tell me?
Rachel: Ohh, its gonna be so great! Im gonna get to help decide what
we sell, Im gonna have an office with walls and everything 
Im gonna have walls!
Phoebe: Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding
reception
Monica: Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that 
 Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from
catering
Phoebe: But weve only had one job
Monica: I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like
its snowballing, yknow?
Phoebe: Yeah! What are you saying?
Monica: I got offered the head chef job at Allesandros
Phoebe: What?
Monica: Its okay, cause y'know what? You dont really need me
for the business
Phoebe: Youre the cook! With out you its just me driving up to
peoples houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Monica: All right But umm, I-I-Ill pay you back all the money you
invested, and you can keep the van
Phoebe: For what? I cant believe this! I gotta get out of here  
Monica: Phoebe, wait a minute! 
Rachel: Im an assistant buyer!!
Joey: All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and
well head back out
Chandler: Yeah, all right
Ross: Okay
Joey: So, were having fun, right?
Chandler and Ross: Yeah
Joey: We dont need that wizard guy We hit a couple of clubs, talked to
some strangers, and uh, after this, well head down to the docks and see about that
boat thing
Ross: Im kinda beat
Chandler: Actually, me too
Joey: Are you serious?!
Chandler and Ross: Yeah
Joey: Thank God! Im exhausted!
Gunther: So you guys want coffees?
Joey: Yeah, but uh, I dont want to be up too late, so uh, Ill have a
decaf 
Ross: Yeah, me too
Chandler: Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I
strained my voice screaming in there Does it have to be so loud?
Joey: I cant hear a word youre saying, my ears are ringing so bad
Ross: Im just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, yknow? I used
them as mittens, I didnt want to touch a thing in that last place
Ross: How sad are we?
Joey: Yeah, I know
Chandler: Yknow what? Were not sad, were not sad, were
just not 21 anymore Yknow? Im 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a
comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Joey and Ross: Yeah!
Joey: Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my
friends
Chandler and Ross: Yeah!
Ross: And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Joey: Were 29, were not women
Monica:  Ohh, here you are Yknow, Im-Im glad you
decided to hear me out
Phoebe: Okay, Im hearing
Monica: Ive been doing a lot of thinking A lot! And umm, well, I came up
with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van Okay umm, you could be flower
delivery person
Phoebe: What?!
Monica: Or! A bakery delivery person
Phoebe: I wa-I wa-I wa
Monica: Pizza?!
Phoebe: Monica! 
Monica: All right, Ive got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but
umm, Im getting the feeling that you dont want to deliver
Phoebe: No
Monica: Okay Im guessing that if you dont want to deliver, you
probably dont want to pick stuff up either
Phoebe: No
Monica: Yknow what, lets do the catering business
Phoebe: Really?! Are you sure?
Monica: Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you Yknow what, itd
be, itd be fun
Phoebe: Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, lets
plan the wedding reception 
Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van 
Yknow what, I want you to take the chef job
Monica: Really?!
Phoebe: Yeah Thats what you really want Yeah, I dont want to be
the reason youre unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really
dont want to be the reason Im unhappy
Monica: Thank you
Phoebe: Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team
Rachel: Oh, hi Mrs Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Mrs Lynch: Oh my goodness! You havent heard!
Rachel: Heard what?
Mrs Lynch: Joanna passed away last night
Rachel: Oh my God! How?!
Mrs Lynch: Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Mrs Lynch: I know!
Rachel: Oh, God Oh, God  Oh God
Mrs Lynch: I didnt realize that she was so close
Rachel: Yes, so close Mrs Lynch, I know that this is an
emotional and difficult time, for all of us But by any chance did Joanna send any
paperwork your way before it happened
Mrs Lynch: No Nothing Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few
seconds later
Rachel: Yes-yes, just a few seconds and shed still be with usnothing
about an assistant buyer?
Mrs Lynch:  No, Im sorry I have to go 
Sophie:  Good morning!
Rachel: Oh, Sophie, I guess you didnt hear about Joanna
Sophie: I sure did! 
Allesandro: Im so excited about having Monica come on board with us
Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, its like losing a member of
the family Of course, that literally is the case for several of you
Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much were gonna miss him Now, I
know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review
So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef
Monica:  Umm, I just wanna say, uh  that with a
pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the
recipe  Are you gonna kill me?
s04e10
Ross: Hey! 
Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Im sorry Im late, did I miss anything?
Phoebe: Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth 
Ross: 15?  Your personal best! 
Phoebe: Where were you?
Ross: Oh, on a date Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum
upstate
Chandler: Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Phoebe: Oh, which museum?
Phoebe:  No, answer his
Ross: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the
door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars She was totally at my
mercy
Chandler: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Ross: No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie She
seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours
away
Chandler: How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie? 
 That joke wouldve killed in Albany
Joey: Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now? 
Chandler: Hey, look at this!  Theyre lighting the big
Christmas tree tonight
Phoebe: Umm, that papers two weeks old 
Chandler: All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really
wanted to take Kathy to this, I cant believe I missed it
Rachel: Hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate
being alone this time of year! Next thing you know itll be Valentines Day,
then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn tree
again Ohh, I want somebody! 
Yknow, I want a man!!  I mean, it
doesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would be
great
Chandler: Really?! I didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling
Rachel: Well, believe me, its been a long time since Ive been flung
Joey: Well, I know what Im giving you for Christmas
Chandler: Yknow what? Theres some nice guys at my office, do you
want me to set you up?
Rachel: Yeah! Wait a minute, its been a long time that Ive been
single How come you never offered this before?
Chandler: Well, I have a girlfriend, Im-Im happy So, I no longer
feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy
Rachel: Okay! No accountants Oh, and no one from like legal I dont like
guys with boring jobs
Chandler: Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
All: Hey!
Phoebe: Whats wrong Mon?
Monica: Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me
Phoebe: Oh
Monica: I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I
get off work and I find out that they wrote this  on my chefs
hat 
Phoebe: Hey, maybe they meant to write, Quiet, bitch
Rachel: Hey, honey! Whats the matter?  Fine, I
was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Monica: I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they
had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me 
Joey: Ohhh!
Monica: I mean theyre trying to do everything they can to make me quit,
and if there were any other job, I would But this is something Ive been waiting for
my whole life
Rachel: Well, wait a minute, youre the boss! Why dont you just yell
at them? Or, fire them?
Monica: I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you know
that Im not good at confrontation
Chandler: Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,
I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so
he could fire them in front of everybody Then they would all know, whos boss
Joey: Hey, Mon! Im not doing anything, why dont you fire me?
Monica: Thats a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Joey: Good enough to get fired
Monica: All right, youre hired!
Joey: Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy
direct Burger King commercials?
Chandler:  Yes
Chandler: I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? 
Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im
not gay, Im not asking you out Im not-Im not-Im not gay!
Drew: I didnt think you were gay I do now
Chandler: See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up
Drew: Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any
thing serious
Chandler: Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a
fling, that might be all right with Rachel
Mike: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas
party, Rachel?
Chandler:  Oh, by the way, that is her full name
Mike: Oh wow! Im free for her!
Drew: Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!
Mike: Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game
tomorrow?
Drew: Hold on, yknow I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I
bring them by your office around uh, five?
Chandler: Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to
stay, but sure!
Mike: Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch
Basel Hadens
Chandler: Well, I dont really know what that is, but lets!!
Phoebe: Hey! You guys, Im writing a holiday song for everyone Do you want
to hear it?
Monica, Rachel, and Joey: Yes!
Phoebe:  Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Rachel: Pheebs, thats great!
Phoebe: Oh, yay!
Rachel: But yknow umm, Rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle
Phoebe: I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Joey: What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel Bagel Mail
Jail Bail Able May-pole
Phoebe: All good, thanks  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a
nickname thats easier to rhyme?
Monica: Didnt your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Rachel: Oh yeah!
Phoebe: Pumpkin? Yeah But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Chandler:  Hello, children!
All: Hey!
Chandler:  Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Rachel: Really?!
Chandler: Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing
themselves at me! Theyre buying me drinks! Theyre giving me stuff! 
Knicks tonight?
Joey: Sure! Where are the seats?
Chandler: Wherever! Ive got like 20!
Rachel: So, will I like any of these guys?
Chandler: Yknow what, Im gonna uh, play the field just a little
more
Rachel: Chandler!
Chandler: Guys are signing over their 401-Ks to me?
Phoebe:  You work with robots!!
Chandler:  Yes  Okay, theres this one guy, Patrick, I
think youre gonna like him, hes really nice, hes funny, hes a
swimmer
Rachel: Ohh, I like swimmers bodies!
Chandler: Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit
cards
Rachel: Op, I like credit cards!
Chandler: See, Im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Rachel: Well, so what does he do?
Chandler: Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division
Rachel: Your company has a fine foods division?
Chandler: Its a big company, I dontif youI
Joey: Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Phoebe: No! No, the robots just work for them
Monica:  All right, Im gonna go to work Does anybody have a
problem with that?
Joey: Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Monica: You want a problem? Ill give you a problem!
Joey: Oh, what are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?
Monica: You bet your ass, Im gonna fire you! Thank you 
Ross: Oh, wow! I should get going I-I got a date tonight
Chandler: Oh yeah! With who?
Ross: You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Chandler: Yeah
Ross: Not her Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide
between the two of them Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a
two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun But this
other girl, well, she lives right uptown Yknow shes, well
shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes not
fun
Phoebe: If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Ross: Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow? She lives so
close And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that
wasif she was kidding was very funny On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding,
shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist
Joey:  Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Hey, man!
Phoebe: Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Joey:  Damn! 
Joey:  Hey
Monica: Hey
Joey: Hey, what happened to your fancy chefs jacket? 
Monica: They baked it I cant take this anymore Im gonna call a
meeting tonight, Im gonna fire you tonight
Joey: You got it! Oh-oh! 
Monica: What are you doing?!
Joey: Its still a tiny bit on fire there
Monica: Thanks  I think you got it!
Rachel:  Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Chandler: Well, like father, like son
Rachel: Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this
could maybe turn into something serious
Chandler: Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I
thought you were looking for some kind of a fling
Rachel: Well, y'know, possibly  You didnt tell him that, though?
Right?
Chandler: Ummmmmmmm, no
Rachel: You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell
the guy that!
Chandler: Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just
looking to getoh I see
Rachel: Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting
out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea
Monica: Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Joey: Yeah Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey Since
I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work
nickname
A Waiter:  Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday
Joey:  Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in
this one!
The Waiter: Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays And it never
hurts to wear tight trousers
Monica: Okay Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is
nobody writing these down?
The Waiter: Because we can remember them
Monica: Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like
you did the other night?
The Waiter: Well, sure, that too
Monica: Okay, forget the specials for a minute Umm, all right heres the
thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive
atmosphere
The Waiter: Cant hear you!
Monica:  A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here 
 From now on, it is gonna be my
way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! 
 Hey new guy! I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?!
Joey: No maam
The Waiter: Hey! He has a name, its Dragon Do you wanna know your name?
Check your hat  We did the hat right? 
Monica: What the hell happened?!
Joey: I am so-so-so sorry I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there
with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,
"Wow! Its been a long time since I had 
 327 + 238 dollars!"
Monica: Joey, we had a deal That-thats why youre here! Ive
got to fire you!
Joey: And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You dont fire me,
instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and theyll start listening to all the nice
things Ive been saying about you
Monica: What kinda things have you been saying?
Joey: Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in
Phoebe:  Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica Very merry
Chandler:  Oh, yknow, yknow what Pheebs?
Phoebe: What?
Chandler: Im not Jewish, so
Phoebe: So! Ross doesnt really decorate his tree with
floss, but you dont hear him complaining do you? God! 
Chandler: Bad dream?
Ross: I wasnt sleeping
Chandler: Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebes song about?
Ross: The one with the cat I gotta go, Ive got another date
Phoebe: So, did you pick one yet?
Ross: No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke But it was a
different joke than I thoughtit wasnt that funny So Im still torn
Phoebe: Well look, you dont really like the one from uptown and
youre too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end
them both Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your
way back you break up with uptown And then by the time you get home tonight, youre
done!
Ross: Yknow, youre right Thank you
Phoebe: Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague
Chandler: Prague?
Phoebe: Theres sooo much you dont know
Rachel sees this and holds the door open until Chandler is ready to start his swing, when
he is, she slams the door shut which causes the club to fly from his hands He turns
Rachel: Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me Did you or did you not
tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Chandler: I did! I absolutely did!
Rachel: You idiot!!
Chandler: Im sure youre right, but why?
Rachel: You dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious
relationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Chandler: Oh, man Im sorry, Im so-so sorry
Rachel: Yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to
people!
Chandler: I know! I know!
Rachel: Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being
alone, sucks! 
Chandler: Well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody!

didnt have to lie once 
Rachel: Really?
Chandler: Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Rachel: No
Chandler: Oh, it doesnt matter  Hey,
yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna come
with me?
Rachel: Cute guys in little shorts? Sure
Chandler: Well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry Canadians
with no teeth
Rachel: Well that sounds fun too 
Chandler: Have you ever been with a woman?
Rachel: What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Chandler: So there is no good time to ask that question

Alice: Weve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got
engaged, we thought wed get a jump on things, yknow no ones getting any
younger
Frank: See the thing is umm, were not able to yknow, uh, conceive
Alice: And weve tried everything, weve seen a bunch of doctors
Frank: Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby
is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into
another girl So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into
Phoebe:  Thats a really nice gift I was thinking of like a gravy
boat
Joey:  Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! 
 Guess which job I got
Chandler: I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black
Ross: What?
Chandler: Blue blazer back He-he wants it back
Rachel: But you-you said black Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Chandler: Well, you-you know what I meant
Monica: No, you messed it up Youre stupid
Chandler: So what job did you get Joe?
Joey: Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum Yeah, Ross got it for me
Rachel: Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur
expert or something?
Joey: No, not really They give you all the information, its uh, its
like memorizing a script  "And on your left, you have
Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period
Chandler, Monica, and Rachel:  Great!! Thats great!
Ross: Uh actually Joey, its the Cretasous period
Joey: Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic

Monica: Are you serious?
Phoebe: Yeah
Joey: Youre really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Phoebe: Ewww! And "Oh no!" Itsthey just want me to be the
surrogate Its her-its her egg and her sperm, and Im-Im just the
oven, its totally their bun 
Joey: Huh
Monica: What did you tell them?
Phoebe: Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to
think about? Im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give
Chandler: Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play
Station?
Rachel: Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are
things to think about
Monica: Yeah, like youre gonna be pregnant I mean pregnant
Phoebe: I know!
Ross: Pheebs, youre talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and its all for somebody else!
Phoebe: Yeah, whats your point?
Ross: Well, the stuff I just mentioned
Rachel: Wow! I dont know if I could ever do that I always figured the
first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be akeeper
Phoebe: Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim
furniture
Joey: No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive
like crazy
All: Yeah
Monica: We just want you to think it through
Rachel: Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby Like
your mom?
Phoebe: My mom never gave birth Oh! But my birth mom did
Kathy: Umm,  I love this touchy Can I
take it to work with me?
Chandler: Oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway It can with the pants
Kathy: Oh! 
Monica: I am so jealous
Rachel: You guys are really rightthere arent you?
Chandler: Yes Right where?
Monica: In the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex
and talking and
Chandler: Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking
Monica: And the sex?
Chandler: All right, we havent had sex yet Okay, whats the big
deal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the
next level
Rachel: Oh, Chandler that is so nice
Ross: That is really nicelying! No way is that the reason!
Rachel: Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand something
like that?!
Chandler: No, hes right, Im totally lying
Rosss little Im-flicking-you-off-but-Im-not-giving-you-the-finger
Monica: Then what is it?
Chandler: Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey
Ross: And youre afraid you wont be able tofill his shoes
Chandler: No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him
Ross: Yeah, I was going for the metaphor
Chandler: Yes, and I was saying the actual words
Monica: So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt
mean hes great in bed
Chandler: We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes
to agree with him a lot
Monica: Sweetie, with you its gonna be different The sex is gonna be
great, cause you-you guys are in love
Chandler: Yeah?
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Just go for it Chandler
Monica: Yeah, you should
Rachel: Yeah, you should, really
Monica: Go on

Joey: Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period
Smart Kid: Isnt the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Joey: Shhh! This is a museum, no talking Right down here, 
 we have a large foot 
 Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller  Everyone wave
Hi to Ross Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at
work 
 Okay, moving right along Come on
Phoebe Sr: Its open! Come in!
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe Sr: Hi!
Phoebe: Im sorry, Im late
Phoebe Sr: Oh, thats okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples
Phoebe: Wow! You really go all out when youre expecting company
Phoebe Sr: No, I was working on my pottery
Phoebe: Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didnt know that you didpot
Phoebe Sr: Well, yeah, mostly nudes It combines my two passions, pottery and
erotica
Phoebe: Ooh, erotiery!
Phoebe Sr: Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me I just-I just
thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person
Yknow
Phoebe: Okay
Phoebe Sr: I really dont think its a very good idea, Phoebe
Phoebe: Why not?
Phoebe Sr: Well, because youd be giving up a baby, and I-I really
dontI dont know if theres anything I can say that could make you
understand the pain of giving up a baby So, umm, 
Phoebe: Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Dont-dont hurt the
puppy
Phoebe Sr: No-no-no, the-the puppys yours
Phoebe: Oh, I get a puppy!!
Phoebe Sr: Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days
Phoebe: Why?
Phoebe Sr: I realise I dont have any right to start get all parenty on you
and everything now, but umm, 
 uhh Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy,
its very important 
Phoebe: Okay
Phoebe Sr: I mean, I know what Im talking about I gave up two babies, and
I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible
it is to give up babies I just think that, it would be something you will regret every
single day for the rest of your life So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it
would be like a million times harder to give up a child 
 I really shouldnt have given you the puppy first
Phoebe: All right, Im sorry
Joey: Uhh, do you mind sitting there Im-Im saving this for my
friend Ross
Tour Guide: You mean Dr Geller?
Joey: Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname
Tour Guide: Oh, he wont sit here Only the people in the white coats sit
over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here
Joey: Well, how-how come?
Tour Guide: Thats just the way it is
Joey: Thats crazy
Tour Guide: Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats
and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now See that scientist in
the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but
now Peter! Hey, Peter! Its me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my
puddin which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack!  See, he pretend
he dont even here me!
Joey: I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you Anyway,
look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is
one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he will sit
in it!  Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I
saved you seat
Ross: Thats okay, Im cool over here Ill catch up with you
later, Joey 
Tour Guide: Op, this is saved  Gift shop
Ross:  Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in
the cafeteria today
Joey: Its no big deal Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do Right?
Ross: But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never
sit together
Joey: Whatever
Ross: Its like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here Where
you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other
chefs, right?
Monica: I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me
Joey: Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal Yknow you wear a
white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so
be it Yknow, hey I understand Yknow? Hey, when Im in a play and
youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right? So its yknow,
its uh, its cool Ill see you tomorrow 
Rachel: Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he
does wave
Chandler: Hi
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Phoebe: Ooh, yknow what, I think its time for puppy to go out again
Come on, lets go to the balcony
Monica: What?!
Phoebe: Umm, the street Come on, lets go to the street Ooh, listen,
dont go onto the balcony until after I get back 
Monica:  So, did you do it?
Chandler: Yes, yes, we had the sex
Monica: Uh-oh, it was bad?
Chandler: It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me as
strongly as she agreed with Joey She was more like, "I see you point, Im all
right with it"
Monica: Well, it was the first time Yknow, theres not always a lot
of agreement the first time
Rachel: Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that
Chandler: Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a
woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice But I need to
know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodys killing her in
there!"
Monica: All right, Im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont
know Rach, give me that pad, please?  All
right Now
Chandler: Look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! Shes
hot!
Monica: Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones 
 You got one, two three, four 
, five, six, and seven!
Chandler:  There are seven?!
Rachel: Let me see that  Oh, yeah
Chandler:  Thats one?
Monica: Its kind of an important one!
Chandler: Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down
Rachel: Well, yknow, sometimes that helps 
Monica:  Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set
up camp
Chandler: That-thats bad?
Rachel: Well if you go to Disneyland, you dont spend the whole
day on the Materhorn
Chandler: Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Monica: All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit
em all, and you mix em up You gotta keep them on their toes
Rachel: Oo, toes!! Well, for some people 
Monica: All right Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,
5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,
6-7, 7, 777-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7!

in the middle Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell
sit with me
Joey:  I will sit with you Dr Geller 
Ross: Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something
unnatural about the way we eat lunch Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow
what I see, I see-I see division Division, between people in white coats and people in
blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these
coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath 
 Im Ross! Im divorced, and I have a kid!
Joey:  Im Joey! Im an
actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!

kidney!
Alice:  Hi!
Frank: Hi!
Alice: Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so

still no pressure
Alice: None But if there was something you wanted to tell us, were just

Phoebe: Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided
Im gonna carry their baby
Phoebe Sr: But Phoebe
Phoebe: No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is
a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this
Phoebe Sr: Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but its justthat was my
puppy
Phoebe: Oh!
Monica: Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?

s04e12
really early Everyones asleep, and all through the apartments not a creature was
stirring, not even a mouse That is except for the chick, who turns out to be a rooster
and is crowing in the sun Needless to say, this awakens Monica and Rachel who rush into
Rachel: What the hell is that?!!  What the hell is that? Is

 Were getting a second opinion
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Rachel: Well, Ive been up since six Thanks to somebodys
dumb-ass rooster
Phoebe: You guys you really should get rid of those animals They shouldnt
be living in an apartment
Rachel: Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
Phoebe: All right Im gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if
Im ready to have Frank and Alices embryo transferred into my uterus

Phoebe: Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Dr Zane: Um-hmm, five actually
Phoebe: Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the
stairs?
Dr Zane: We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will
attach
Phoebe: Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75
percent chance of no baby at all!
Frank: Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you
stuff like 200 of them in there?
Alice: Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine
Phoebe: Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause
Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right
Frank: Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot
to make it right
Alice: Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this So, umm, were kinda
using all the money we have to do it just this one time
Phoebe: Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a lot of pressure on me and my
uterus  So, well okay, so is thereis maybe is there something that I
can do yknow just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Dr Zane: No, Im sorry
Phoebe: Wow! You guys really dont know anything!
Frank: I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in
my high school

it
Rachel: Bloomingdales eliminated my department 
Monica: Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Rachel: No, but they stuck me in personal shopping Which is just a huge
step down!
Phoebe: Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty
rich people and tell them what to buy?
Rachel: Uh-huh
Phoebe: That sounds great!
Joey:  Hey! 
Monica: Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments You cant eat are food

Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Ooh! How was Kathys play?
Ross: Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good
lookin guy
Chandler: Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst
nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Phoebe: Thats a good idea for a business!
Chandler: Im totally screwed Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on
stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes
gonna try to undermine me Y'know itll be like, "So wheres your
boyfriend, whats-his-name, Chester?" And shell go, "No-no-no,
its Chandler" And hell go, "Whatever Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Joey:  That-that is a good trick
Chandler: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Joey: Chandler, look theyre actors Theyre there to do a job, just
cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together I mean
just cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesnt mean
its gonna happen with them
Ross: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger
Joey: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman 
Ross: Yeah
Phoebe: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood
Ross: Theyre not a couple!
Phoebe: Oh-okay, I get the game now
Joey: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on
stage, was it like really hot?
Ross: Oh yeah!
Joey: Well okay, so then youre fine The rule is when two actors are
actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone Okay? So as long
as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about Its when the heat goes
away, thats when youre in trouble
Chandler: Really?
Joey: Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever
had chemistry on stage?
Ross: No
Joey: Noooo!!
Chandler: So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Ross: Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how
hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend
Chandler: Yeah, I know but

Monica:  Hey!
Joey: Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Monica: You made pancakes?

muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades Which Im fairly certain
are the same thing
Joey: Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday
night, if people want to come over
Ross: Oh yeah!
Monica: Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game
Joey: Oh yeah, whos playing?

Chandler: Im right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them
Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey
told us what this means!
Ross: All right, lets not jump to any conclusions All right? There was
some sexual chemistry between them
Chandler: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!

Rachel: Really? It doesnt seem desperate?
Joey: Oh-ooh, thats the turn-on
Phoebe: He just got a divorce right?

her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with Nick, and they
wouldve ended up in bed together I threw her at his man nipples!
Rachel: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it
does not justify her sleeping with someone
Ross: Well, if-if she thought they were on a break

wallet here on purpose Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again Oh, Im glad

missed your call, even though I didnt leave the flat all day 
Rachel: Oh well, no I
Emily: Oh, no-no-no, thats not rude! Its perfectly in keeping with a
trip that Ive already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been
strip-searched at John F Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone
whos got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum

time! Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it
Monica: Yeah Run ten blocks, thatll help the smell
Rachel: Heywhoa, slow down  No, keep moving 
 Wow!
Monica: So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Rachel: Well, I didnt see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl
in the face
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Why?
Rachel: The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got
there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep
Phoebe: Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Rachel: No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and
she was all, "Im Rachel Greep! Im Rachel Greep!" and he let her
right in 
Monica: So you hit her in the face?
Rachel: No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal
my umbrella, so I clocked her Ohhh! I cant believe this, all I wanted was a few
hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me
Phoebe:  Aww, Pheebs
Rachel: Honey, thats youre name
Phoebe: Thats short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called
each other!
Monica: Hey! Youre wearing pants!

see some strippers

Chandler: Maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time 
Ross: When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who
wouldnt be miserable? Im telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person
Emily:  Ross! Come quickly! Theres a deer just outside eating
fruit from the orchard!
Ross: Ive gotta go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard! 
Monica: He had to go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the
orchard
Rachel: I dont get this! She was horrible! 
Chandler: Okay, Im going to go stand over there 
Monica: Why do you care so much anyway?
Rachel: I dont care! All right, yknow what Im just upset that
Im getting nowhere with Joshua thatyknow what still, you do not meet
someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Monica: Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail

I think it is?
The AD: You?
Joey: No-no, its uh, its Heston
The AD: What?

then ate some liquorice 
The AD: Theres no way he smells, hes the only one around here with
a shower in his dressing room
Joey: Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?

Monica: Very good,

Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Phoebe: Come on! Look where you are!!
Monica:  When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris

Charlton Heston: I dont know one actor worth his salt that didnt say
at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there,

how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and
use my shower! Do you understand me?!

The Brits both crush their cans, and not to be out done, Ross crushes his coffee cup,
Janice: Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Chandler: Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were
complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River
Janice: Oh, look at us! Who wouldve thought that Cupid had a station at
14th Street Nails 
Chandler:  Okay, we have to talk Im just getting out of a very

Monica: Done?
Phoebe: Yep!
Rachel:  Hey!
Joey: Hey! Whats up?
Monica: This switch thing has been driving me crazy So I turned it off and
checked every outlet Now, four of them dont work Which means, one of them
has to be controlled by the switch So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets
that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out
which one it is
Joey:  I bet I stopped listening before you did
Rachel: Yknow, you-you also couldve used uh, lamps and then
followed the light
Monica: Yeah, well, Im using noise Okay All right! So, is everybody
ready? Here we go  I hear something! I hear
something! Where is it?

carries the sport

totally craving meat This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make
it think it was getting meat, yknow? And I got nauseous
Chandler: Maybe thats because soy-burgers suck!
Phoebe: Being pregnant is tough on your tummy
Joey: Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow
Phoebe: Thats sweat You throw up all morning, youll have that glow
too
Joshua:  Okay!

Rachel:  Oh no-no, no-no, they dont want you to put your
hands in the pockets until you are out of the store
Joshua: Why not?!

Rachel: Huh Well, uh, thats uh, thats interesting 
Joshua:  Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
Rachel: Oh, its just an anti-theft device
Joshua: Then uh, whats-whats this? 
Rachel: You need that, you need that too cause obviously, a thief could
just tear this up 
Rachel: Oops, sorry Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we

Chandler: What are you talking about?
Joey: Yeah, what going on?
Rachel: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily But its
actually for Joshua  Look, he said hes not ready to
date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I
have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! 
Ross: Well, as much as Id like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I
arent going to be here All right? I mean, shes going to come by first to say
good-bye, and then Ive got a whole special evening planned So Im sorry, no

Emily: Oh, but the partys only just getting started!
Ross: Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15
minutes and then yknow, then The Plaza for dinner
Emily: So why did you plan a party at the same time?

short Its usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, Im so
surprisedgood-bye!"
Emily: But Ross, Im such having a great time! Your sister has just been
telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea

Chandler: She was a welder
Joey: What? Were you like in the movie, or Anyway, she takes off
her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve Very sexy, and classy
Monica: Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe
Rachel: Its not Christmas!
Monica: Or Spin the Bottle?
Rachel: Hes not 11!
Emily:  Thank you so much for
this It was really so thoughtful of you
Rachel: What? Youre leaving?!

big thing planned!
Ross: What big thing?
Rachel:  So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the
bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther

 All right Who wants to go first?
Emily: Ill go
All: Yay!
Joey: Welcome to America 
Monica: Two in a row! Youve got to use your tongues now!

crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her
Phoebe: Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
All: Ohh!
Rachel: Its okay! Its okay! It kicked once, itll kick again!
All: Oh my God!
Rachel: All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting 
Rachel: Just a bug
Phoebe: Yknow it doesnt matter how much Im craving it

murder
Chandler: Okay 
Chandler: Theres a Phoebe on my sandwich! 
Joey: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Phoebe: I cant help it I need the meat The baby needs the meat
Joey: All right look, yknow how-yknow how when youre dating
someone and you dont want to cheat on them, unless its with someone really
hot?
Phoebe: Yeah, totally!
Joey: All right Okay Well this is the same kind of deal If youre going
to do something wrong,  do it right!
Joey: Feel better now?
Phoebe: Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, Im
gonna eat like, yknow millions of cows
Joey: Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise
Phoebe: What?
Joey: Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Phoebe: Yeah
Joey: Well, suppose until the babys born I laid off it No extra animals
would die, you-youd just be eating my animals
Phoebe: Joey, I cant believe you would do that for me
Joey: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian Theres no meat in beer, right?
Ross: Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked
for our check right away
Emily: But, we cant go now It looks like Rachels gonna put on a
skit
Monica: Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rachel: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly My lucky dress
wasnt working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed

Rachel: Ughhhh!! Forget it!  This is, this is not
how this is supposed to happen

Rachel: Can you not look at me when I say this?  I thought that
if I could get you here, I could seduce you
Joshua: Huh Oh, boy!  Uhh, I-I dont wear suits to
work, and I bought six of them from you
Rachel: Well, Im sorry, I thought you needed them!

sophisticateda lot of this isnt based on tonight

Rachel: Well, maybe you didnt want it to end?
Ross: What do you mean?
Rachel: You seem to really like her
Ross: Yeah, I really do Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, yknow no commitment
Rachel: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicas photo albums, I mean you
dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks
Ross: You think?
Rachel: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
youre sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip
Ross: Hey, youre right
Rachel: Yeah
Ross: Thanks  What photo album was it?
Rachel: I dont know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids
Ross: Oh my God! Those werent albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!

Mr Treeger: What in the name of hell?
Joey: Maybe he found you flip-flop
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustve hit something on the
remote
Chandler: Do we pay for this?
Joey: No, we didnt even pay our cable billmaybe this is how they
punish us
Chandler: Maybe we shouldnt pay our phone billfree phone sex
Joey: Maybe we shouldnt pay our gas bill? 
Mr Treeger:  Whoa, hey, that ladys all kinds
of naked
Chandler: Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Mr Treeger: Yeah, it happened to me once I was just flipping through the
channels and bam! It was like finding money
Chandler: Like finding money with naked people on it!
Mr Treeger: Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back
again And Im sad 
Joey:  Why would he turn off the TV? 
still on, there are three women getting ready to shave the chest of some guy Joey and
Chandler are wondering why that guy is letting them shave his chest, and Monica and Rachel
Rachel: All right, yknow what, come on, do we really have to watch this
while we eat? 
Joey and Chandler:  Oh no-no-no-no!
Chandler: We dont know what could make this go away
Joey: Yeah, so no one touches the remote And no one touches the TV!
Chandler: And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey: Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Monica: Well at least, Im going to mute it
Joey and Chandler: Oh no-no-no! 
Chandler: We still have porn
Joey: Hey
Phoebe:  Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Rachel: Honey, what are you doing? Thats too heavy
Phoebe: Yeah
Rachel: Give it here  Oh, God 
Monica: Okay
Phoebe: Ohh, Im getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid
massage table Yknow, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table 
Chandler: Or a job where you dont have to carry a table
Phoebe: You mean like a doctor?
Joey: Pheebs! Youre blocking the porn! Look out!
Phoebe: Ohh!  Oh my Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN
today
Ross: Hi
Monica: Hi
Ross: So uh, Emily just went to the airport
Monica: Oh Why didnt you take her?
Ross: Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it And yknow, we-we
said our good-byes this morning, so
Monica: You must feel horrible Hey! The guys have free porn!
Ross:  Nah
Monica: Hey, cheer up! Youre gonna see her again, right?
Ross: Well I, thats the thing, I dont know! I mean, whenever I
brought it up with her she said,  "This is so fantastic! Why do
we have to talk about the future? Lets just enjoy"
Monica:  No-no-no, dont-dont do the accent
Youve got to see her again
Ross: And why do you care so much?
Monica: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross: You had fantasies about Emily?
Monica: No! Yknow, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,
fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together
Ross: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that
Ukrainian kid?
Monica: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ross: Ahh
Monica: Do you love her?
Ross: We said it was only going to be two weeks, yknow?
Monica: You love her!
Ross: What-what is love really?
Monica: Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport
and tell her Youre probably just gonna catch her just as shes about to go to
the gate Youre gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And
shes gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most
amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud
Ross: I am a good kisser
Monica: Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to
heat up, and then a stewardess comes in  Ive been watching
too much porn
Rachel: Is that the heartbeat?
The Doctor: Thats it
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Rachel: Oh wow! This is so cool
The Doctor: Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Phoebe: Why dont take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again,
Ill hold onto your card, okay?
The Doctor: No, Im getting three separate heartbeats
Phoebe: Three? You guys were worried I wouldnt even have one!
The Doctor: Doctors are wrong all the time
Phoebe: Well, yeah
Rachel: Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
The Doctor: Definitely 
Phoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months
Im going to have three full grown babies just walkin around inside me?! Oh!
Oh! And its gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
The Doctor: Actually, giving birth to three babies isnt that different
from giving birth to one
Phoebe: What do you know?!
Alice:  Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Phoebe: Ooh! Hi!
Alice: Hi!  So, how did it go at
the doctors?
Phoebe: Oh well, okay, hey, yknow how when youre umm, youre
walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh,
thats nice?"
Frank: Yes
Phoebe: Okay, yeah well, good news, youre going to have three babies
Alice: Three babies?
Frank: I finally got my band!
Alice: Were gonna have a big family, Ive always wanted a big family!
Phoebe: Oh God, Im so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were
going to be all freaked
Frank: Why would we be freaked?
Phoebe: No, no maybe cause its harder to raise them, and the added
expense, and
Frank:  Oh
Alice: Right
Phoebe: No, back to happy Back to happy!
Alice: No-no-no, no, its going to be fine Because umm, because I teach
Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long Yknow
itll-itll be like my very own little sweatshop 
Frank: Yeah, Ive been thinking ever since you said we were having
triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job
Alice: No, Frank
Phoebe: No you cant quit college! No! Youre in college? Really?
Frank: Yeah, refrigerator college
Alice: Yeah
Frank: Yeah, yknow when we found out we were going to have a baby,
yknow I figured yknow like I should yknow have like a careerand I
love refrigerators!
Phoebe: You cant give up on your dream
Frank: No, its okay Were-were gonna have three kids! And
thats-thats a different kind of dream Three kids and no money

Joey: Yeah right
Rachel: No, he told me He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination
Chandler: Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was
corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Rachel: Yes!
Joey: Yeah, he likes porn
Monica: Where ya going?
Rachel: Im going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too

Phoebe: Hey
Joey: Hey!
Monica: How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Phoebe: Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is
having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I
want to talk to you  about, cause you work for a big company
Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me
Chandler: They dont really talk to us about that kind of stuff I can get
you some free white out though
Monica: Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Ross: I did
Monica: And well, what did she say?
Ross: Thank you
Monica: Oh, youre totally welcome! Whatd she say?
Ross: She said, "Thank you" I said, "I love you" And she
said, "Thank you"
Chandler: Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Joey: Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Ross: What do I do now?
Joey: You play hard to get
Ross: She already lives in London
Joey: Then you go to Tokyo
Chandler: All right look, forget it, forget it You told her you love her,
its over
Monica: It is not over! Youre over!
Chandler: What?
Monica: You know!
Chandler: Okay  Good one
Monica: It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves
you And the reason why she couldnt, is because her feelings were so strong, it
scared her Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the
plane! Come on now go! Go! 
Ross: Okay! Okay! But if she doesnt call, it is definitely over! No, wait
Wait Unless, eventually, I call her, yknow just to she whats going on, and,
and she says shell call me back, but then she doesnt Then its
over
Joey: Way to be strong, man!
Rachel: Hey!
Chandler: Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn
break We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again
Rachel: Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
Chandler: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn
Phoebe:  Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel: Well, what-what cha got there?
Phoebe: Oh this, well Im glad you asked 
 Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an
ordinary steak knife?  Ahh! Now, I know what youre
thinking
Chandler: Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Monica: Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
Phoebe: No!
Monica: Are you sure?
Phoebe: No!
Rachel: Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice
just by selling knives
Phoebe: No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second
part of my plan
Chandler: Whats the second part of your plan?
Phoebe: My Saturn dealership
Ross:  Hello?
Emily: Ross
Ross: Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Emily: It was dreadful I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those
wonderful things
Ross: No, no, that-that, thats all right Umm, Im just glad you
called
Emily: Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you,
theres-theres someone else
Ross: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Ross: She doesnt know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy
Monica: This isnt how its supposed to go, there cant be
another guy
Ross: Well
Monica: Of course theres another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you
have to prove your love!
Ross: Im not proving anything Okay, Im done listening to you If I
hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never
wouldve put my fist through the wall!
Chandler: You put your fist through the wall?
Ross: No, I missed and hit the door But, it opened really hard!
Monica: You have to go to London!
Ross: What?
Monica: Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Joey: Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense Yeah Cause you already told her
you love her and she didnt say it back, then she called you and told you that
theres another guy, so yeah, go to London thatll scare her!
Monica: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Ross: I made fun of his accent
Monica: You sat back and let him have her, you didnt fight at all Am I
right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Ross: No
Monica: All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be
you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer Just, go to London!
Ross: Really?
Monica: Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Dont let her go
without a fight!
Ross: All right All right, Im gonna do it! 
Monica: All right
Ross: Im gonna, Im gonna go to London and Im going to fight
for her
Monica: Okay, good luck!
Joey: Ross! Ross! If youre going to the airport, could you pick me up
another one of those Toblerone bars? 
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! Im
gonna open up my own massage place and Franks gonna help me! And! We can work it
around his schedule so he doesnt have to quit school!
Monica: Thats sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Rachel: Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys
used for catering and we realised
Phoebe: Im telling it! Im telling it!
Rachel: Okay
Phoebe: Okay You know how people need transportation, but they also need
massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the
massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know
what Ive got?
Chandler: A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Phoebe: No! Think about it, its a taxi that people take when they need to
relax, its
Rachel:  Relaxi-Taxi!
Phoebe: The name was my favourite part!
Rachel: Well, well I can up with it!
Phoebe: YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! Thats
not good
Rachel: Well, I
Monica: Hello
Ross:  Hey
Monica: Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Ross: No, because she hasnt come home yet And she hasnt been home
all night! Shes obviously staying with that other guy, and Im the stupid moron
who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Monica: All right When is, when is the next flight out?
Ross: About four hours
Monica: Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnt show
up by then, then just come on home
Phoebe: Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks
thats better than Relaxi Cab
Rachel: Okay, its not Relaxi Cab Its Relaxicab, like taxicab 
Phoebe: Oh, that is better
Chandler: Are we in London?
Monica: What are you doing here? You cant be here!
Emily: Ive uh, Ive come to talk to Ross
Emily: What?
Joey:  Nothing No, nothing
Emily: I was going to call him, but
Monica: Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it!  I
was right!  Im right, right?
Emily: Id really rather talk to him 
Monica: Oh
Emily: I uh, Ive been to his apartment and he wasnt there, and uh I
need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
Emilys phone ring with amazing clarity Apparently, sound travels quite
easily through the walls of British buildings Anyhoo, Ross looks around for the ringing
phone and in the meantime Emilys answering machine picks up and once again with
Emily: Ross, are you there? Ross, I dont know if you can hear this
but  Im
gonna talk anyway, uh, Im in the States with you sister and your friends and

that I love you
Ross: 
 I love you too! Im, Im gonna call you right now from the
phone booth!  You cant hear me 
Emily: I wish I could know if youd heard any of that I suppose Ive
either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh Mrs Newman if
youre listening, bugger off this in none of your business I suppose theres
not much chance you did heard that, and theres the call waiting so, I should go Oh

Ross: Hi
Emily: Ross, I love you!
Ross: Ohh! Thank you
Chandler: Hey

gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!

Alice:  No No No  Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl
baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR JR 
Chandler: Wouldnt that be Frank the III?
Alice: Dont get me started  Anyway, umm, since there are three
babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named
the other boy baby
Phoebe: Wow! Thats so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar
Alice: You think about it 
Emily: I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will
think its yours and be horribly traumatised? 
Ross: Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra
Emily:  Ohh, its time to go
Ross: Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17

Susan: Ahh!
Ross: Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so

Ross: Oh come on! Thats-thats true
Phoebe: Hi!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Phoebe: Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book 
 and found nothing! I want a name thats really like, yknow strong and
confident, yknow? Like-like Exxon 
Chandler: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid
Joey: Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Phoebe: No, Im-Im not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name
starting with "The"
Joey: Oh, want a good name, go with Joey Joeys your pal Joeys your
buddy "Where is everybody?" "Well, theyre hanging out with
Joey"
Chandler: Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre
gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler  Oh,
come on! Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get
to know him
Joey: Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if
you need him, hell be there

little late, but-but, hell be there And hell bring you some cold soda, if
want you need him for is that youre really hot
Joey: What do ya say? What do ya say?
Phoebe: Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey
and Chandler are great names  But, all right, I
dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk
Joey: I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to
name my kid!
Rachel: Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time
tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing 
Monica: Yknow what? It really creeps me out choosing other

Rachel: Sorry Im so exited! Ive been waiting for this for months! I
got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! Im making him a very fancy meal 
Monica: Um-hmm
Rachel: What am I making him by the way?
Monica: Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine
nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup
Rachel: I thought I was making him filet mignon? 
Monica: Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left
over at the restaurant And then you realised if you  bitched about it,
then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to
make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke
Rachel: Wow, I really get crabby when I cook

would take them a long time to peck their way back over here
Joshua: Okay, thats-thats not funny Uhh
Rachel: Okay, yknow, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I

Ross: Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I
dont know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Carol: Whats too much fun?
Ross: Yknow, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married
Carol: Oh my God, you are so paranoid! 
Ross: Am I?!
Carol: Yes!
Ross: Am I?!
Carol: I cant speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed
relationship
Ross: Uh-huh, Carol, so were we All right, just-just imagine for a moment,
Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off Yknow? Say-say theyre
coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,
theyre laughing, yknow, someone innocently touches someone else
Theres electricity, its new Its exciting Are you telling me there
isnt even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Carol: Maybe
Ross: OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
Joshua: and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to
God, that duck pushed me!
Rachel: Wow! This place is fabulous!
Joshua: Yeah, yeah, let me show you around This is the uh, downstairs living
room
Rachel: Whoa-whoa, theres two living rooms? God, growing up here, this
place mustve been a real babe magnet
Joshua: Yeah, well, it wouldve been, but uh, my parents just moved here
Rachel: Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet Wanna make out?
Joshua: Hey, heres an idea Why dont uh, I put the food in the
fridge and we can eat it later?
Rachel: That sounds like a plan Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Joshua: Oh yeah, yeah uh, its down the hall and uh, second door to your
left
Rachel: Ah
Mrs Burgin: Oh, hi, darling!
Joshua: Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?

Mrs Burgin: Oh, say no more!
Mr Burgin: Well just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs,
and well be right out of you hair
Joshua: Oh, that-that would be great So you didnt even get to Italy?
Mr Burgin: Yep, sucks!
removed her dress and is wearing nothing but a lace nightie She tries to find someplace
seductive to wait for Joshua She tries to sit on the piano, but it makes too much noise

Mrs Burgin: Hello Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries
Rachel: What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is
notthats-thats not what it is See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see
and-and, this is a real dress actually Its-its, theyre-theyre
wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people
respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdales, so
And obviously in uh, in-in this case,  I am going to report
back, "USA not ready"
Mrs Burgin: Maybe in LA?
Rachel: Yes!
Joshua: There you go
Mr Burgin: So, have you kids eaten yet?
Rachel: Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next
Mr Burgin: Well, were starving, why dont we all go get something to

Joey: Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Chandler: No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!
Joey: Its not that bad
Chandler: Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name
Joey: So, youre just Bing?
Chandler: I have no name
Phoebe: All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Chandler: Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint
Joey: No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint
Chandler: Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Phoebe: Umm, Gene
Chandler: Its Clint Its Clint! 
Joey: See you later, Gene
Phoebe: Bye, Gene
Chandler: Its Clint! Clint!
Joey: Whats up with Gene?
Monica: So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Rachel: Oh, yeah And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled
water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh, no!
Rachel: No, its all right I got nice boobs 
Ross:  So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she
and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! 
Rachel: So?
Ross: So! Poetry? Susans gay! Theyre being gay together!
Monica: Emilys straight
Ross: Oh, wake up!
Phoebe: Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Ross: Excuse me?
Phoebe: Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,
sycophant  All right, so I dont know what sycophant means,
but the rest is right
Ross: Look, I dont know what youre talking about, I am not a crazy,
jealous person
Rachel: Huh
Ross: What?
Rachel: Shes totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out
about Mark and there was nothing going on
Monica: This totally makes sense!
Ross: It does not!
Monica: Oh, sure it does! In high school, you werent jealous at all even
though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Phoebe: All right, all right, so up until 92-93 he was very trusting, then
94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely!
Monica: This is so much fun!
Ross: This is not fun!
Monica: Look, all were trying to say is, dont let what happened with
Carol ruin what you got with Emily
Phoebe: Yeah The 92 Ross wouldnt
Ross: Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing
Rachel: Whatyeahwhat, yknow what? I hope Emily is a
lesbian
Phoebe: Drum roll
Chandler:  Okay Okay All right Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Joey: Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good
Barney
Chandler: All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down
to the courthouse
Phoebe: Youre actually going through with this?
Chandler: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life Okay,
its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with
women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or
John Markson
Phoebe: You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got
to stop! Chandler is a great name! In factyes,  Im, Im sorry I
know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im
gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler
Chandler:  Really?!
Phoebe: Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Chandler: Okay Thanks
Phoebe: Okay!
Chandler: You wanna hug it out?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Yay! 
Chandler: Yay! 
Phoebe: Yayohyay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Chandler: Okay!
Phoebe: Ooh, uh 
Chandler: Bye, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Okay, bye! 
Chandler: Ha! Ha! Ha!
Joey: Ohh! 
Ross: Nice luggage
Carol: I was gonna say
Susan: Hey!
Ross: Hi!
Emily: Hey! I missed you
Ross: Oh, I missed you too
Susan:  Thanks for everything, I had such a great time
Emily: Oh, so did I
Ross:  No tongue

read Flowers for Algernon?
Joey: Yes! Didnt you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I
didnt read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!

more than just season seats

much more

tickets?

Rachel: hormones, yeah
Phoebe: Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet

Phoebe: Good Yknowno-no, okay, its-it feels like
everythings been about me lately, so whats happening with you?
Rachel: Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to
Rosss wedding
Phoebe: Oh!
Rachel: It just might be too hard, given the history and all that
Phoebe: Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street
and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him
Rachel: Well, h-how is this like that?
Phoebe: Well, lets see, its not Really, like that Because, you see
that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like yknow a bunch of
yknow high school crap that nobody really gives yknow
Rachel:  Im-Im sorry, I just thought that
Phoebe: Alrighty, here come the water works 
Joey: Ugh! I dont know what Im going to do! I called the company
that sent and th-they dont care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this
isnt an emergency, then what is?
Ross:  Hey guys!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey
Ross: I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And
the guys from work had a blast Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor
party before Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
Joey: So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!
Ross: Yeah, right!
Joey: I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for
myself, I might want to get one of those
Ross: That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and
the clothes on her back were all she had with her
Chandler: So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? 
Ross: Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride
who has worn it has had a long and happy life
Chandler: So you might say, its a magic ring
Joey:  Yeah, the stripper stole it
Ross: My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Chandler: Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why
dont you be my best man"
Ross:  All right-all right, fine! I-Im gonna call the
cops!
Joey: Dude, I screwed up, you dont have to turn me in!
Ross: Not on you! On the stripper!
Joey: Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said theyre gonna look into
it right after they solved all the murders
Ross: Okay, well, well call the company that sent her!
Joey: I did that too! They wouldnt give me her real name or her number
They said, "If I bothered them again theyd call the police" I said,
"If you talk to the police, you tell them Im missing a ring!"
Ross: So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That theres
nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Joey: Look Ross, I am so-so sorry I-I-I
Chandler: Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her
come to my office?
Joey: Oh, that sounds like fun, but weve got a ring to find!!
Monica: Heres your tea Phoebe 
Phoebe:  Its so good 
 Oh, thanks
Rachel: Good
Monica: Im so glad you liked it
Phoebe:  Oh! 
Monica: What?!
Rachel: What?! She made the tea! 
Phoebe: Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction
Rachel: You what?
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that
was definitely one
Monica: Wait, you cant have the baby here! I mean I havent
sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Rachel: Okay Its okay Were gonna be okay Yknow what?
Its okay Im gonna, Im gonna, Im gonna boil some water and just
rip up some sheets!
Phoebe: No Its all right; its probably false labour They said
that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book
Monica: Rachel, get the book! The book!
Rachel: Okay!  Okay! Here!
Monica: The Bible?!
Rachel: I dont know!
Joey: All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk

she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I  You be Mr Gonzalez, and Ill
be uh, Mr Wong
Ross: Diverse
The Stripper: Did anybody call for security?
Chandler:  You be cool 
The Stripper: Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? 
Hey, Joey?
Ross: Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is
it? Where is it?
Chandler: Way to be cool, man
The Stripper: Whats he talking about?
Joey: There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
The Stripper: Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
The Guys: Yeah!
Ross: We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
The Stripper: Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I dont need to
steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys
make that?
Chandler: Marry me 
Joey: I dont get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didnt
take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?
 Shh! Were trying to think! 
same moment and stare at Joey, who doesnt get it After a short pause, with the duck
Rachel: I still dont get how you know when its false labour
Phoebe: Well, do you see any babies?
Monica: How do you feel?
Phoebe: Okay, I guess I mean I dont know, its just, I guess I
know its going to be over soon
Rachel: Well, isnt that a good thing? You said you were sick of this
Phoebe: I know Its just yknow usually when youre, when
youre done with the pregnant thing, yknow, then you get to do the mom thing
Im gonna be yknow, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila
Monica: Some moms do that
Phoebe: Okay thats even sadder Look, I know, I know what I got myself
into, its just that now that theyre in me its like, its like I
know them yknow, I mean-I mean, its just not gonna be easy when these little
babies have to go away
Monica: Aww, sweetie, but its not like youre not gonna have
anything Youre gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways thats even
better
Phoebe: Yeah, okay
Rachel: No, really Really, Pheebs, youre not gonna be the one worrying
about saving for college, or yelling at them when theyre bad, yknow, or
deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just wont calm down Yknow?
Monica: I mean, youre the one theyre gonna come to when they wanna
run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex
Rachel: And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!

Joey: So! Things can go wrong! You dont know! What if he doesnt make
it?!
Chandler: He will, Joe
Joey: Yeah, but what if he doesnt? Hes such a good duck
first one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off Then its
Chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler
reading to him in bed, and him watching Baywatch when all they had was the canoe
and the duck was in a bucket of water Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck
watching him He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table Then its Chandler
shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls apartment, Joey revealing their disco
cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them,
and its concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping its wings And
Joey: Im so worried about him, yknow?
The Doctor:  Somebody lose a ring?
Ross: Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!

Phoebe: Oh Oh
Rachel: Oh, honey! Dont get up! What do you need?
Phoebe: Oh, no Oh, nothing
Rachel: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything
Phoebe: Okay, I have a wedgie
Rachel: Okay, that is all you
Phoebe: So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Rachel: Oh, I dont know I guess we have to eat
Phoebe: Yeah, I do Whats the matter?
Rachel: Im just bummed about the way I left things with Ross I
shouldnt have lied to him about having to work He seemed so mad at me
Phoebe: Eh, dont be so hard on yourself If someone I was still in love
with was getting married
Rachel:  Still in love with?! 
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: Im not in love with Ross!
Phoebe: Oh No No Good! Yeah, me neither
Rachel: Phoebe, Im going to Rosss wedding because he is my
ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable Not because, Im still in
love with him! I mean, hey, yknow, I like Ross as much as the next guy, yknow?
Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings dont mean love! I mean, I still
have loving feelings for Ross Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but
that doesnt mean that-that Im still in love with him Yknow? I-I have
sexual feelings for him, but I do love himOhh! Oh my God! Oh mywhy
didnt you tell me?!!
Phoebe: We thought you knew!
Rachel: We?!
Phoebe: Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Rachel: You all know? Does Ross know?
Phoebe: Oh no, Ross doesnt know anything
Rachel: Oh, I can not believe you didnt tell me!
Phoebe: Well, because we thought you knew!! Its so obvious! God, that
would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean"
Joey: Hey!
The Vendor: So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves,
tulip post cards
Joey: Check this out? Huh? 
 Yeah Thats the stuff What do you think?
Chandler: Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid"
T-shirt anymore
Joey: Well, I like it Here you go 
Chandler: All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you?
Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Joey: Oh, I embarrass you? 
Chandler: How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
The Vendor: Hes just jealous Youll fit right in; all Londoners wear
them!
Chandler: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
The Vendor:  Theyre all tourists
Chandler: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,
yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself
Joey: Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between
you and the hat? I choose the hat
The Vendor: Good choice
Joey: Thanks
Chandler: Okay, wait All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here I
am not going to be embarrassed anymore! 
Emily: Hello?
Ross: Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think
well be able to find a new place for the wedding
Emily: We dont have to
Ross: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Emily: No But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit
Ross: She said what?
Emily: She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere
that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it"
Ross: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents
spent on this wedding? Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that
people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? 
 This isnt right
Emily: I realize that people are going to be disappointed But, Im sure
theyll come back when we can do it right
Ross: I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Emily: Dont you point your pants at me!  We
have no choice! Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross
dont you understand? This is our wedding Im talking about
Ross: The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option This is
when were getting married
Emily: So what are you saying? Its now or never?
Ross: No Im saying its now 
Emily: Or?
Ross: Theres no or in mind What is wrong with these pants?!!
Emily: Its not the pants Its you that is backwards And if, and if
you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we
shouldnt get married at all! 
Ross:  No,
wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel:  Hi
Phoebe: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Rachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores
Phoebe: Well, I think I can help you get over him
Rachel: You can?
Phoebe: Yeah I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross
Rachel: Um-hmm
Phoebe: And a small piece of chocolate
Rachel: Okay
Phoebe: And a glass of tepid water 
Rachel: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Phoebe: Uh, only if you have the hiccups too Yeah, the pictures are for you,
the water and the chocolate is for me I just didnt feel like getting up Okay,
Im gonna show you a picture of Ross Okay? And youre going to remember all of
the bad things about him All right? Really focus on his flaws
Rachel: I can do that I certainly did it when we were going out
Phoebe: Okay Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
love Ross, I think hes such a great guy Here 
 Okay, now, close your eyes And imagine that youre with Ross
okay and imagine that youre kissing him And youre-youre running your
hands all over his body And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross
its some kind of grease, itsuck! Hah?
Rachel: I dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,
and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy
Phoebe: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought Umm, lets try
some uh, aversion therapy
Rachel: Okay
Phoebe: Okay?
Rachel: All right
Phoebe: So uh, now look at the picture
Rachel: Okay
Phoebe: All right, and umm 
Rachel: Ow!
Phoebe: Okay, how do you feel now?
Rachel: Well, I like you less!
Joey: Hey
Chandler: Hey 
Joey: Oh  Sorry!
Chandler: No-no-no, yknow what? I really shouldnt have said that you
were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnt cool And if it makes you feel any
better, Ive had a really lousy day
Joey: Me too
Chandler: Yeah?
Joey: Noo!! Ive had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!
Monica:  Hey!
Joey: Sh-shh-shh! 
Joey:  Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat
Fergie:  Okay, so umm, whats your
friends name?
Joey:  Oh, Chandler
Fergie: Hi Chandler!  
Chandler: Thats Thats was
Monica: Oh my God!
Joey: Thats Fergie baby!!
Fergie: Joey says you dont really like his hat, but I think its
kinda dashing
Chandler: How did you? How? How?
Joey: Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
So, Im in my map and-and Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hi I understand you had a little talk with Emily
Monica:  Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Ross: Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Monica: Umm
Chandler: Im gonna go to the bathroom
Joey: Wait up! 
Ross: Hey-hey, since youre the fix-it lady, heres a
pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesnt want to have the wedding at
all?
Monica: She said that?!
Ross: Yeah
Monica: Why?!
Ross: I dont know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just
because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out
Monica: Oh my God Youre even dumber than I am!
Ross: Excuse me?
Monica: Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Ross: I dont know A month?
Monica: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head Thats what we
did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top 
 Thanks But the most
important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that
other stuff was
Ross: I had no idea And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were
just doing the flying nun
Monica: Sometimes we were
Ross: Come on You gotta help me figure out what to do Okay?
Monica: Okay
Ross: Come on 
Chandler: That was pretty intense huh?
Joey: Yeah  Hey, I hope Ross didnt think that we just went in
there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Chandler:  I hope he did!
Phoebe: Hello
Joey:  Hey, Pheebs! Its Joey!
Phoebe: Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on thethat looks just
like you on the subway And I was gonna go over and say hi! but then I
figured, he doesnt care if he looks like you
Joey: That just cost me four bucks But uh listen, I just called to see how the
chick and the duck are doing?
Phoebe: Ohh, theyre having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!
Aunt Rachel hasnt been helpful at all So, do you miss me?
Joey: Kinda, but Ive just been having way too much fun
Phoebe: So youre not homesick yet?
Joey: No, I dont think so
Phoebe: All right, the seven of us miss you
Joey: Whos seven?
Phoebe: Yknow, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies
Joey: Ahh, the babies miss me?
Phoebe: Ooh, the pizza guys here!
Joey: What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Phoebe: Yeah But yknow we were thinking about you, yknow we ordered
the Joey Special
Joey: Two pizzas?!
Phoebe: Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later
Joey: Wait, well, where did you get it from?! 
and turns on a rerun of Cheers, with the theme song playing At first, hes
Emily: Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Monica: Youll see
Emily: I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen
Emily: Oh God
Ross: Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer
bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
Monica: And the musicians, look, they can go over here 
, okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You
go
Ross: But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place
at any other time Really, its fine, whatever you want
Emily: Its perfect
Ross: And, I dont know, if it starts to rain
Emily: Well then well get wet 
Monica: Ohh And I dont even have a date
Rachel: Pheebs?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Rachel: Do you remember where the duck food is?
Phoebe: Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink Why?
Rachel:  Because Im going to London
Phoebe: What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
Rachel: Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him Now honey, you take care, you
dont have those babies until I get back  
Phoebe: IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
Rachel: Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision
Phoebe: Thats not why youre going! Youre going because you
hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach Forget that British
chippy"
Rachel: OhhDo you think he will?!
Phoebe: No! Because hes in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if
you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Yknow,
its too late! You missed youre chance! Im sorry, I know this must be
really hard, its over
Rachel: Yknow what? No Its not over until someone says, "I
do"
