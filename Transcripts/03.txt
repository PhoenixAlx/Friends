to mean that I was calling her a cow 
Rachel: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it
Chandler: Okay, well Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at
her
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa You looked at her You never look You just answer, it's
just a reflex Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Rachel: Nooo!
Ross: And it works both ways
Chandler: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Rachel: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on
Ross: Okay, for instance Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she
gives you two options Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport Option 2
is you can meet her at baggage claim Which do you do?
Chandler: That's easy, baggage claim
Ross:  Wrong! Now you're single It's actually secret option number
three, you meet her at the gate That way she knows you love her
Chandler: Okay, this is good, this is good All right listen, I have one Janice
likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for But, uh, you know when you want to
go to sleep, you want some space So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,
accidentally calling her fat or something
Rachel: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily
sleepers  Okay, I'm late for work

name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was

when I came up with the baby plan 
Ross: Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that
guy's name? Dad!
Monica: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if
I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just
stupid
Chandler: That, that's what's stupid

Chandler: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Monica: Oh, now you want a pad
Carol and Susan:  Hey!!
Ross: There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi 
 What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Carol: He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it
Susan: He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski
boots and a kicky beret
Ross: Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Susan: So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and
be in show business
Carol: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by
two women, does it?
Ross: You know what it's fine If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so
am I
Ross: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi
Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? 
 No Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? 
Rachel: Ross, you are so pathetic Why can't your son just play with his doll?
Monica:  I gotta go to work Has anybody seen my left
boob?
Joey: I love that movie 
Monica: There it is Joey, what are you doing?
Joey: I'm sorry, it just felt nice
Chandler:  Joe Joe! Answer the phone
Joey: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know You should be doing stuff for me
Go get me a sweater
Chandler: Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see
her tonight  Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight
Rachel: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Chandler: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her
chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes
Ross: And that's bad because, you hate chicken piccata?
Chandler: Noo
Ross: You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to
you
Chandler: No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple And this alarm
started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Rachel: Men are unbelievable
Monica: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel
something, you have to run away?
Chandler: I know, that, 
 that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say
something stupid
Monica: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until
you get us to break up with you
Joey: Hey, you know about that?!
Chandler: Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of
the commitment thing I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! 
Ross:  Where there is no fear of commitment
Chandler: Do we have any Do we
have any thoughts here?
Joey: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand
it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right But, it
seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear It have a fear
of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugsget a bug
Right In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the
most committed guy there ever was
Rachel: Amazingly, that makes sense
Chandler: You think?
Joey: Oh, yeah Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of
the gun, pee into the wind!
Chandler: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm
pretty much peeing every which way
Phoebe: Oh, it's your audition from this morning Can I use the phone again?
Rachel: Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and
pretend agents
Joey: Come on baby, come on!
Phoebe:  'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a
page Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through'
Rachel: Very nice touch
Phoebe:  'Okay, go ahead'  Um, hi
Annie  Fantastic!  You got it  Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work
for scale?' you ask me Well, I don't know about that, 
 except that I do and he will Great, oh you are such a sweetheart I would love to
have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next Op, went through a
tunnel
Rachel: Unbelievable
Joey: Thank you so much
Phoebe: It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before
Joey: You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's
this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in
Phoebe: Oh, I don't know I mean it was fun one time
Joey: Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two
Phoebe: Two?
Joey: Yeah! Well, well really it's three Please You're so good at it I love
you
Phoebe: Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Joey: Nooo, four
Janice: So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Chandler: 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this 
Janice: Ohhh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know
what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper
Chandler: Well, wait there's, there's more See the contact paper is to go into
your brand new drawer  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser
Janice: Oh, you didn't have to do this
Chandler: Yes, I did Yes, I did Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what
girlfriends should, should get 
Janice: Well, I gotta buy a vowel Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought
that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer
Chandler: Well, not me But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's
more We should take a trip
Janice: We should?
Chandler: Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do And, I wanna meet your
parents We should take a trip with your parents!
Janice:  I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right
now! Are you okay?
Chandler: I am, I actually am I mean this is amazing My entire life I have
feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal I could probably
say 'Let's move in together' and I'd be okay
Janice: You probably want us to move in together?
Chandler: It doesn't scare me!
Janice: Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler You
know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about
moving in together And, and I wasn't even that hungry You know what, it's getting a
little late, and I-I should just, um
Chandler: Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm
hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! 
 Hey, Janice! It's me Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna
apologize in advance for having chased you down the street 
Rachel: Honey, this will help 
Chandler: So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going
to fast and we have to slow down
Rachel and Monica: Uff
Monica: That is never good
Chandler: Then I got all needy and clingy
Rachel: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute Maybe it's not so
bad How did you leave it?
Chandler: She said she'd call me
Rachel and Monica: Ohh! 
Chandler: Oh God
Monica: Welcome to our side of the tunnel
Chandler: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way
Rachel: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk We sort of, we
save the real stuff for those really terminal cases
Monica: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch
to low-fat
Rachel: Yeah, you do
Chandler: So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Monica: Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some
damage control
Chandler: Okay, okay So, should I call her?
Rachel and Monica: Nooo!
Rachel: This is a very critical time right now If you feel yourself reaching
for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath You want
her back you have to start acting aloof
Monica: She has to know that your not ready
Rachel: Right So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose And then act aloof
Chandler: So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Rachel: Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser
Chandler: I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Rachel: Oh
Ross: Guess who's here It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben  'A
real American hero I'm GI Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi
Rachel: GI Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Joey:  G I Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Ross: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects US oil interests overseas!
Joey and Ross: Go Joe!!!
Phoebe:  Helloo! Oh!

Phoebe: Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Joey: It's okay, these things happen
Phoebe: But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,
terrible business Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that
Joey: I'm, I'm okay See 
Phoebe: Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,
okay, I just quit
Joey: No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,
rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally
Phoebe: Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian
actor with a worse Italian accent
Joey: They actually said that?
Phoebe: Yeah Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I
Joey: No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie You
know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this 
 I canna work on a new accent
Phoebe: Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay Yeah
Ross:  You'll never get me, Joe!!! 
then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's
Janice:  No, thank you 
Chandler!
Chandler:  Hello, Janice
Janice: What are you doing here?
Chandler:  Oh, just a bit of shopping How've you been?
Janice: Are you being British?!
Chandler:  No Not anymore
Janice: Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood Were you
here waiting for me?
Chandler: Yeah, huh I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a
party 
Janice: Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Chandler: Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours
Janice: Where is this party?
Chandler: Here in Chelsea
Janice: Who's party is it?
Chandler: A woman's
Janice: What woman?!
Chandler:  Chelsea
Janice: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here Either you're
seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet Or,
else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that
I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle So like which of these two guys do
you want to be? 
Chandler: Can I be that guy?
Phoebe: Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on 
Joey: Okay, shoot
Phoebe: Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial
Joey: I didn't get it?
Phoebe: No They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being' So, you can
work on that 
Joey: Okay, what else?
Phoebe: Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb'
Joey: Oh
Phoebe: Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb'
Joey: Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this
Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle
Phoebe: Oh
Joey: Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at
least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out
Phoebe: Yeah, no, I understand
Joey: You do, thanks
Phoebe: Yeah Sorry 
Joey: Wait a minute
Phoebe: What?
Joey: Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of
being my agent
Phoebe:  Oh, you caught me I am so busted
Joey:  That's-ah what I suspected-ah
Chandler: And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran
out of the store
Monica: My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'
Chandler: I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream
now, right?
Rachel: Yeah, it is
Monica: You know what, everything's gonna be okay 
Chandler:  Hello Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?
Okay  Okay, what do I do?
Rachel: ShhhI don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented
Monica: If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call
Rachel: Yeah
Chandler: Hello!
Monica: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke
up, okay, that will throw her off Be sleepy
Rachel: Yes, and grumpy
Chandler: What are you, stop naming dwarves!  Hello, Janice Hi, I'm

twenty, and you come out looking like Mr Big Shot You really want to be Mr Big Shot?
Here, Ill tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr Big Shot, all right 
Ross: Well Mr Big Shot is better than wethead
Joey: Okay, some tricks of the trade Now, Ive never been able to cry as
an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a
pair of tweezers, and just start pulling Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that
Ive just done something evil That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my
eyebrow and I like it 
 Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try
and divide 232 by 13  And thats how its done Great soap
opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed
Student: Hey, Mr Trib
Joey: Hey-hey

we act fast, okay So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice
Ross: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work
Rachel: Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats
why you have got to be the bigger man here
Ross: Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I
could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except
that I could pick your Father up and say Like me! Like me tiny doctor!
Rachel: Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For
me?
Ross: Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything You gotta face it, okay
were never gonna get along
Rachel: Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay Because I already got a
Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna
have to have a separate room for you too!! 
Ross: Okay, okay, okay  Ill get the bagels

have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor I had such an opportunity in the
recent, present And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to
play a role, homosexually Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned
out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him And now, hes got a two
year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me

TV Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry

Phoebe: No thanks, I have a good one too I just, I, I cant see him
Chandler: See that is the problem with invisible dentists
Ross: Why? Why cant you go to him?

the hygienists blouse
Rachel: Phoebe, what? Ummwhat?!
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,
my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob
Rachel: And all these people actually died?
Phoebe: Yes, while I was in the chair! Thats why I take such good care of
my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Ross: Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened
to die when you went to the dentist Its, its, its just ah, a
coincidence

have to tell him
Joey: Itll kill him I mean itll, itll just kill him
Phoebe: Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe Ill
kill him
Joey:  Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock

Phoebe: Oh, can I play too? Ive never played football, like ever 
Joey: Great, you can cover Chandler
Chandler: No, no, no, I dont, I dont really wanna play
Joey: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up
Chandler: Thats not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut
clusters all day I wanted to start drinking in the morning Dont say that I
dont have goals!
Joey: Chandler, you have to start getting over her All right, if you play, you
get some fresh air, maybe itll take your mind off Janice, and if you dont
play, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams wont be even Come on
Chandler: Yeah, all right, Ill play
Phoebe: Yay!!
Rachel: Lets do it! Ross?
Ross: What?

Ross: Um, Monica and I arent supposed to play football
Joey: Says who? Your mom?
Monica and Ross: Yeah
Monica: Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football
game called the Geller Bowl
Chandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly
Monica: Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kindve
competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Rosss nose
Ross: It was soo not an accident She saw I was about to tag her, so she
threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face And just keep running
Monica: To score the winning touchdown, by the way
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown
didnt count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose
breaking
Monica:  I won the game
Ross: Oh yeah! Then how come you didnt get the Geller Cup?
Rachel: Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Ross: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game But our Dad said,
nobody won that game,  and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy
and  threw it
in the lake
Chandler: And was the curse lifted?
Ross: Anyway Thats when our Mom said we were not to play football ever
again

Rachel: All right, so are we not having dinner at all?

Ross: Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough
for a touchdown, and starts to dance in celebration Chandler then tackles him, and he
and runs up to him and tries to tackle him But all she ends up doing is running around
standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum Something hits her on the head and
Phoebe: I love this game!!
Ross: Hey, whered you get that?
Rachel: I went really long
Monica: Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Ross: Its no surprise that your winning, cause you got to pick
first, so you got the better team
Monica: Youre so pathetic! Why cant you just accept it, were
winning because Im better than you
Monica: Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, Ill
prove it to you, okay Ill trade you Joey for Rachel, and Ill still win the
game
Ross: What?! The guys against the girls? See, thats ridiculous Monica,
because Im only down by three touchdowns
Monica: Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to
a bunch of girls
Ross: Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey youre with me
Rachel: I can not believe your trading me!!
Monica: Come on Rach, come on Lets see whats it like to be on a
winning team for a change
Rachel: Are you gonna let me play?
Monica: All right then
Margha:  The game is over, we eat now?
Chandler: No-no-no-no, the games not over, were just switching

double covered, in desperation she throws to Rachel We see flying through the air, and
then Rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then Rachel again, then the ball, then
Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey staring at it in shock Then with the grace of Jerry Rice 
, Rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball Both
Rachel:  I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Chandler: Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing Actually, the ah, end zone starts at

be allowed to fly this thing?
Gunther: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah
Gunther: Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks
getting trained by another waitress?
Rachel: Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Gunther:  Good one Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training

Chandler:  Yeah?
Sarah: So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons On behalf of the Brown
Birds of America, I salute you 
then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird
Ross: Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand
Chandler: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand
Ross: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl is not a backhand
Chandler: I was shrieking like a Marine
Ross: All right here Watch me execute the three Ps of championship
play Power  Precision  and penache 
backswing and hits Sarah whos started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both
Monica: You broke a little girls leg?!!

Rachel: Im gonna get back to retraining 
Ross: All right, see you guys 
Chandler: Look out kids, hes coming! 
Joey: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees
Phoebe: Have fun Oh wait, no, dont! I forgot I am totally against that
now
Joey: What? Me having a job?
Phoebe: No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and
their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights  Hey,
how do you sleep at night?
Joey: Well, Im pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day Hey,
Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their
fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy
Phoebe: Really?
Chandler: Yes Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of
them, its the only chance to see New York
Gunther: and after youve delivered the drinks, you take the empty
tray
Rachel: Gunther, Gunther, please, Ive worked here for two and a half
years, I know the empty trays go over there 
Gunther: What if you put them here 
Rachel: Huh Well, y'know thats actually a really good idea, because that
way theyll be closer to the mugs Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses
do that too
Gunther: They already do Thats why they call it the tray
spot
Rachel: Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it
was a club they went to Oh God, Im, Im sorry 
Gunther: Its all right Sweetheart
Ross: So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that
you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those
cookies anymore 
Sarah: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle
Ross: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Sarah: Yeah My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments,
as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj
Mahal
Ross: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the
way to India
Sarah: No The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots He says hes
gonna double the college money my Grandma left me
Ross: Huh Well, good luck to Dad Say, how many more boxes would you have to
sell in order to win?
Sarah: The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five
Ross: Yeah
Sarah: So far, Ive sold seventy-five
Ross: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able 
 How much are the boxes?
Sarah: Five dollars a box
Ross:  And what is second prize?
Sarah: A ten speed bike But, Id rather have something my Dad
couldnt sell
Ross: Well, that makes sense
Sarah: Could you do me one favor, if its not too much trouble?
Ross: Yeah, Sarah, anything
Sarah: Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space
shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we dont have a TV, the lady across the
alley said shed push hers up to a window, so I could watch it
Woman: 
Yesss?
Ross: Hi, Im selling Brown Bird cookies
Woman: Youre no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole
Ross: No, hi, Im, Im an honorary Brown Bird 
Woman: What does that mean?
Ross: Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but Im not invited to
sleep-overs
Woman: I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know Now, go away!
Ross: No, please, please, um, its for a poor little girl who wants to go
to Spacecamp more than anything in the world
Woman: Im pressing, a policeman is on his way
Ross: Okay, okay! Im going Im going 
Woman: I can still see you!
Ross: All right!!
Phoebe:  Hey
Joey: Hey What, what are you doing here?
Phoebe: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,
all right maybe I was a little judgmental Yeah,  oh, but oh
Joey: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas
Phoebe: Destiny
Joey: Sure
Phoebe: Yes
Joey: All right
Phoebe: Okay  Yikes!
That one doesnt look very fulfilled
Joey: Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just
taking it to the back
Phoebe: You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist
Joey: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones
Phoebe: So, what happens to the old guys?
Joey: Well, they go into the chipper
Phoebe: Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds? 
points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play
 No! Nooooo!!! 
Joey:  Hey! Hey!! 
Ross: and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,
Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus
Joey: All right, Ill take a box of the cream filled Jesuss
Ross: Wait a minute, one box! Come on, Im trying to send a little girl to
Spacecamp, Im putting you down for five boxes Chandler, what about you?
Chandler: Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Ross: No, but ah, theres coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes I tell you
what, Ill put you down for eight boxes, one for each night
Ross: Mon?
Monica: All right, Ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and
thats it I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds 
Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Ross: Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because
you ate them all But ah, y'know Im sure thats not gonna happen this time, why
dont I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the
Rudolphs
Monica: No
Ross: Oh, come on, now you know you want em
Monica: Dont, dont, dont, dont, dont do this
Ross: Ill tell you what Mon, Ill give you the first box for free
Monica:  Oh God! I gotta go! 
Ross: Come on! All the cool kids are eating em! 
Gunther: And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we dont
just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there
Rachel:  Im training to be better at a job
that I hate, my life officially sucks
Joey: Look Rach, wasnt this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you
wanted to do fashion stuff?
Rachel: Well, yeah! Im still pursuing that
Chandler: How exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out
resumes like what, two years ago?
Rachel: Well, Im also sending out good thoughts
Joey: If you ask me, as long as you got this job, youve got nothing
pushing you to get another one You need the fear
Rachel: The fear?
Chandler: Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go
after a job you really want
Rachel: Well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, I mean why
dont you quit and get the fear?
Chandler: Because, Im too afraid
Rachel: I dont know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,
y'know, or a buyer Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here
Chandler: Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still
working here
Gunther: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah
Gunther: Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular
Rachel: Cant I just look at the handles on them?
Gunther: You would think
Rachel: Okay, fine Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know
why Im a terrible waitress? Because, I dont care I dont care I
dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the
tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do So I dont think
I should do it anymore Im gonna give you my weeks notice

Monica: What do you mean? 
Phoebe: Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh 
Monica:  So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? 
Julio: What? 
Monica: Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't
write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine
comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog Y'know but that does not
mean that I'm empty, I care about things I care about my friends and family You have no
right to make that kind of judgment about me 
Julio: Whoa, whoa, whoa 
Monica: You don't even know me 
Julio: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you 
Monica: What? 
Julio: The Empty Vase is not about you My baby, you make me so sad that you
would think this 
Monica: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe 
Julio: No, it's about all women Well, all American women You feel better now? 
Monica:  Oh yeah 
Director: All right, let's do it!

she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! 
Ross:  Hi 
Rachel: Hello 
Chandler: Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen 
Ross:  I'm sorry, I was an idiot 
Rachel: A big idiot 
Ross: A big idiot Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda
hard for me 
Rachel: Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Ross: Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her And now if
it's possible I think I love you even more So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not
gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away 
Gunther: Let it be me! Let it be me! 
Rachel: Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people
love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous 
Ross: I gotta get going Bye Chandler 
Chandler: Oh, okay Ross Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you
pick me up some porn? 
Rachel: Where ya going? 
Ross: Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon

class Why, is that okay? 
Rachel: Sure, is she married? 
Ross: Ahh, no 
Rachel: Oh  
Ross: Are you jealous? 
Rachel: Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all I
mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? 
Ross: You are totally jealous 
Rachel: I'm not jealous All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain
things y'know about strippers And y'know, and um, I

Rachel: Ugh Wait, wait, wait 
Ross: What? 
Ross: Huh 
Rachel:  Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of
hours, y'know 
Chandler: Yeah Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a
stripper 
Man:  Is there a Julio here? 
Julio:  I am Julio 
Man:  Mister Pretensous,  you think
there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner

Joey: Havent you ever read the same book over and over again?
Rachel: Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once But I mean
thats a classic, whats so great about The Shining?

Shining Okay? And the answer would be: nothing All right? This is like the scariest
book ever I bet its way better than that classic of yours

Rachel: Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on youre gonna ruin it!
Joey: All right Ill talk in code  Remember when the
kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Chandler: Hmmm, thats very cool
Joey: Oh, all blank, and no blank, makes blank a blank blank Oh no-no-no,

get away Aww!
Rachel: Joey! I cant believe you just did that!
Chandler: I cant believe she cracked your code!
Rachel: All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though
shes still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy
Joey: Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the
hotel, and kills the dad
Rachel: Eh Beth dies
Joey: Beth, Beth dies?
Rachel: Um-hmm
Joey: Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Chandler: No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die Does she Rachel?
Rachel: What?!
Ross: Joeys asking if youve just ruined the first book hes
ever loved that didnt star Jack Nicholson?
Rachel: No She doesnt die

Ross: Oh
Phoebe: Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it
on the lose? Is it watching me?
Chandler: We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his stuff
Ross: Hes right, even if its to say something complementary 
Robert:  Hey! 
Phoebe: Hey
Robert:  So are ready for the gym? Theyve got this new rock
climbing wall, we can spot each other

Chandler: Yeah, we got, um-hmm
Phoebe: Umm, I think youre really, really great
Robert: Oh God! Here we go again Why does this keep happening to me? 
 Is it something Im putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
Phoebe: I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say
Gunther:   Hey buddy, this is a family place,

pedals on the bed, and jumps onto the bed and puts a rose in her mouth, and bites a
Monica: Ow!

Richard: Ah well, this is the living room
Richards Date: Impressive
Richard: All right This is the kitchen
Richards Date: Oh, thats real pretty Wait a minute, dont I
get to see the bedroom?
Richard: The bedroom Well its pretty much your typical 
as Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the
 bedroom
Richards Date: Were still on this side of the door
Richard: Um-hmm
Richards Date: Yeah, but I didnt get to see it
Richard: Oh shoot! Maybe next time  Thanks for a lovely evening 
Monica:  So um, who was she?
Richard: Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called
and switched it to today
Monica:  Did you like her? And Im just
asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this
Richard: Well, you seem fine
Monica:  Okay, y'know what, Im not fine, Im not I mean how
can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom 
Y'know what, what if were friends who dont see other people?
Richard: You mean like exclusive friends?
Monica: Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week Would it be so
terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together Or, maybe someday friends who stood
up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever
Richard: Wow Y'know were back where we were Honey, I would love to do
all that, but nothings changed
Monica: Thats not true, you dont have a moustache
Richard: Okay, okay, one things changed But we still want different
things and we know how this is gonna end
Monica: Y'know what, Ive got to walk out of here right now, cause
getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do I dont think I
could do it again
Richard: I know I couldnt So
Monica: How bout one last game of racquetball?
Monica: Watch the thorns!
Richard:  Ow!!
Rachel: What?
Joey: Beth is really, really sick
Rachel: Awwww

Joey: Oooh
Monica: Yeah, Ginger something
Joey: Nooo No, no, ah, are you sure it wasnt something that sounded like
Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Monica: No, it was Ginger I remember, because when he told me, I said,

Joey: Aww, man Thats the girl I was hiding from When she finds out
hes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what I did
Monica: Well, what did you do?

its like the most awful, horrible thing Ive ever done my whole life
Monica: Y'know what, dont tell us Well just wait until Chandler
gets home,  because itll be more fun that way
Joey: All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago Okay, Ginger and I had gone
out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dads cabin Just me,
her, and her annoying little dog Pepper Well that night, I cooked this really romantic
dinner
Monica: You gave her food poisoning!?
Joey: I wish No After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of
the fire Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out
So, I picked up a log and threw it on Or, at least what I thought was a log
Phoebe: Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Joey: I wish See, I guess another thing I probably shouldve told you
about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg
Monica: Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Joey: I ran!!
Chandler: Well, thats the best kiss Ive had with anyone Ive
ever met in a mens room

Rachel: Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with
Mark?
Ross: Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Rachel: I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny

Monica: Uh-huh
Chandler: Oh God, it freaked me out Okay, I know it shouldnt have, but it
did I mean I like her, I dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often its
like Hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? I mean Im the smallest
person in the world arent I? Im the smallest person in the world
Joey:  Morning
Chandler:  Actually hes the smallest person in the world

that funny?

make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Ross: Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about
strappy backed dresses
Rachel: Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium
listening to Professor Pitstains and hes Hey everybody! Remember that thing
thats been dead for a gazillion years Well theres this little bone we
didnt know it had!
Ross: First of all its Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little
bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didnt fly
Rachel: Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah,
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah
Ross: Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I
wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka
Rachel: Oh, that is so
Ross: No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island 
unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake
Rachel: Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with
me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldnt go with Mark?
Ross: No I I wanted to be with you I dont know, I feel like lately, I
feel like youre slipping away from me, y'know With this new job, and all these new
people, and youve got this whole other life going on I-I-I know its dumb, but
I hate that Im not a part of it
Rachel: Its not dumb But, maybe its okay that youre not a
part of it Y'know what I mean?  I mean its like, I-I-I like
that youre not involved in that part of my life
Ross: Thats a little clearer
Rachel: Honey see, it doesnt mean that I dont love you Because I
do I love you, I love you so much But my work its-its for me y'know,
Im out there, on my own, and Im doing it and its scary but I love it,
because its mine I, but, I mean is that okay?
Ross: Sure, I-I-I 
Ginger: Your thinking about my leg arent you?
Chandler: No No Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Ginger: Its okay if it bothers you Really I mean the only thing I need
to know is: How much it bothers you? because I dont like wasting my
time Am I wasting my time?
Chandler: No No I dont think so
Ginger: Okay Its just like anything else, you just have to get used to
it
Ginger: Whats that?

Phoebe: No, look, I told you that I didnt want you to try and sell it, and

wouldve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself And if I
cant trust you then just forget it 
Leslie: No, no, I dont want to forget it
Phoebe: Okay y'know what you have to choose All right, if-if the most important
thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but

Monica: Oh, good Thanks
Phoebe: Now what is Fabutec?
Monica: Okay, all right dont judge me to much Okay? Um, but I saw this
info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,
except for this mop But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so
amazing
Phoebe: Waxine!!
Monica: Yes! Have you seen it?
Phoebe: Oh, its incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl
Monica: I know!!
Phoebe: God Do think it really doesnt hurt? Cause how can they do
that?
Monica: Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain
forest!
Phoebe: They have the best stuff in there
Chandler: Oh my God! Oh my God!
Joey: Yeah We figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to
make up with Rachel Which is probably what you shoulda done Huh?
Ross: You think?! God, I, ah, Im in hell I mean what, what am I gonna do?
Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this And all I
can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say? when I tell
her what I did
Chandler: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more
important question How dumb are you?
Ross: What?! Look, were trying to rebuild a relationship here, right How
am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Joey: Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,
just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble
Chandler: Hes right Nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just
gonna hurt her
Joey: Yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild
Ross: Yeah, but dont you think
Chandler: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait
until the timings right And thats what deathbeds are for
Ross: Yeah, okay 
Joey: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out
some other way  Did you think about
the trail?
Ross: What trail?
Joey:  The
trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!
 You always have to think about the trail!
Ross: Oh, I-I dont think theres any trail
Chandler: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac Issacs
sister is Jasmine And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe And Phoebes
friends with Rachel And thats the trail, I did it!
Phoebe:  After applying the Waxine and linen
strips to leg number one, 
Monica: Did that!
Phoebe: Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull
it off in one quick pain free motion
Monica: Okay  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Phoebe: Was it not pain-free?
Monica: No It was painful Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with
a little wax
Phoebe: Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont
seem to think its that bad
Monica: Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so
stupid But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest
Phoebe:  Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Monica: Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
Ross:  Chloe? Hi 
Chloe: Is this about me taking your watch?
Ross: You took my watch?
Chloe: Im sorry, I do that
Ross: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Chloe: Oh no I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know
Ross: Exactly So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?
Chloe: Oh, well I tell Issac everything
Ross: You tell, of course you do Issac Issac Hey, Issac Issac, hi! Y'know we
havent actually met
Issac: You dog!
Ross: Yes, I suppose I am a dog But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend
Issac: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place
Ross: Yeah, thats the one Listen, I dont want to hurt her
Issac: Oh, hey, man I know, doesnt matter how much we love em,
monogamy is too cruel a rule
Ross: Yeah Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Issac: Aw, no problem dude Y'know we got to look out for each other Were
the same, you and me
Ross: Actually, no, were not
Issac: Yeah, we are
Ross: No, were not
Issac: Yeah, we are
Ross: No, were not!!
Issac: Okay, were not
Ross: Right
Issac: But, we are
Ross: Fine I just need to know that youre not gonna tell your sister
Issac: I can promise not to tell her again
Ross:  Jasmine? 
Jasmine: Uh-huh
Ross: We met at Phoebes birthday party, Im, Im Ross Geller
Jasmine: You did a bad thing!
Ross: Yes, I did
Jasmine: Very bad!
Ross: Very bad
Jasmine: Very, very bad
Ross: Im agreeing with you Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe
yet?
Jasmine: No
Ross: Okay, Jasmine, please, please dont I love my girlfriend very much,
and I want more than anything to just work it out with her Okay?
Jasmine: All right
Ross: Thank you, thank you
Jasmine: But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he
knows Phoebe too
Ross:  Whos your roommate?
Ross: Gunther! Gunther Gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to
Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place
Gunther: Im sorry Was I not supposed to?
Monica: Ow!
Phoebe: Oh!!
Monica: Ow!! Ow!!
Phoebe: Ow!!!
Monica and Phoebe: Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Phoebe: Were all right
Monica: Its okay, its okay
Phoebe: Were all right
Monica: We were just waxing our legs
Chandler: Off?!!
Phoebe: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever
experience
Chandler: Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unless
youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely
Joey: Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,
thats all I mean, come on, its just a little wax
Phoebe: Oh yeah, come here 
Chandler: Oh, thats mature
Joey: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Phoebe: Uh-huh
Monica: Thats right
Ross:  Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Rachel: I cant talk to you I cant even look at you right now!
Monica: What?
Chandler: Nothing, nothing
Monica:  Rachel said everything was okay
Phoebe:  What, what are they talking about?
Ross: Rachel?
Rachel: Just get away from me!
Ross: No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Rachel: A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Phoebe: Whe-where did he put it?!
Rachel: Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Monica: Oh my God
Phoebe: Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not
grow at all yesterday
Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk
Monica: Oh!!  You guys knew about this and
you didnt tell us?!
Chandler:  He has sex, and we get hit in our heads
Rachel:  Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! 
Ross: No!!
Rachel: Just get out! Now!!
Ross: No!! No!! I wanna stay I wanna talk about this
Rachel: Okay! All right! How was she?
Chandler: Uh-oh
Ross: What?
Rachel: Was she good?
Joey: Dont answer that
Rachel: Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk
about it!! How was she?
Ross: She was
Joey: Awful! Horrible!
Chandler: She was not good Not good
Joey: She was nothing compared to you
Ross: She, she was different
Joey: Ewwwww!
Chandler: Uh-oh
Rachel: Good different?
Ross: Nobody likes change
Ross: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay
Phoebe: Should we do something?
Chandler: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel
Ross: Im sorry, okay, Im sorry I wa-I was disgusted with myself,
and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,
and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible
Rachel: Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute What time did your little friend
leave?  Oh my God She was there? She was still there? She
was in there, when I was in there?!
Ross: Listen Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant
nothing to me!
Rachel: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! 
Ross: Look, I didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise I
thought we were broken up 
Rachel: We were on a break!
Ross: That, for all I knew would, could last forever That to me is a break-up
Rachel: You think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Ross: Look, Im not trying to get out of anything, okay I thought our
relationship was dead!
Rachel: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Joey: Y'know what, I dont think we should listen to this anymore 
Monica:  What, what are you doing? You cant go out there
Joey: Why not?!  Im hungry
Monica: Because theyll know weve been listening
Rachel: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Ross: Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to
make sure that didnt happen!
Rachel: Oh, that is so sweet I think Im falling in love with you all over
again
Chandler: Y'know what, I think we can go out there I mean they have more
important things to worry about
Joey: Yeah, well be fine
Ross: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then
Chandler and Joey convinced me not to
Chandler:  Wax the door shut, were never leaving,
ever
Phoebe: Hi, its Phoebe Listen someones gonna have to take my 9:00
with Mr Rehack, cause its like 9:15 now, and Im not there
Ross: Dont you realise none of this wouldve ever happened if I
didnt think at that same moment you werent having sex with Mark?
Rachel: All right Lets say I had slept with Mark Would you have been
able to forgive me?
Ross:  Yes I would
Rachel: Youd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked
with me, and made love to me?
Ross:  Yes
Rachel: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were
Ross:  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,
okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you Because
its, I mean its you
All: Ohhhhh!
Ross: What? Come on Rach, tell me what youre thinking?
Rachel: Im thinking, Im gonna order a pizza
Ross: Order a pizza like, I forgive you?
Joey: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza 
 Put olives on the pizza
Phoebe: We could eat the wax! Its organic
Chandler: Oh great, food with hair on it
Phoebe: No, not the used wax
Chandler: Because that would be crazy?
Ross: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because Im kinda hungry myself
Rachel: Fine  Hi! Yes, Id like to order a large pizza
Ross: No anchovies
Rachel: With ah, extra anchovies
Ross: Thats okay, Ill just pick em off
Rachel: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in

half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up
Rachel: No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live
here!

save us both time and sulk in the car
Ross: No, Rachel doesnt want me to
Carol: Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love

Frank: Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off
Phoebe: Oh no Did umm, did she say why?
Frank: Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I dont

After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and
then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, its still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away And now
its, and now its gone and I dont know why!
Phoebe: Uh, well I can tell you why Its, its because of me But,
y'know what, I only did it because I love you Okay?
Frank: What?
Phoebe: Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made
her see why you two shouldnt be together, y'know And youre gonna see it to,
one day, you really, really will
Frank: Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Phoebe: Okay
Frank: Well, you, wait no, my Mother didnt want us to be together, but the
worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch 
Phoebe: Okay, but
Frank: Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought youd
understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or
a place to go

Joey: Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual
scenarios and stuff huh?!
Kate: Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey: Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! I talk to you and its nothin
You look at me, and nothin  Nothing
The Director: You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up

Monica: Something wrong?
Rachel:

Chandler: So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Phoebe: Okay well, he would turn things to gold

Monica: Wow, youre really crazy about her, huh?
Joey: Oh, you have no idea And-and when were on stage I get to-to kiss
her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and its like
somebodys ripping out my heart!
Phoebe: Oh, its so great to see you feeling like this!
Ross:  Hey!

Ross: Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away
Monica: Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

something thats supposed to be sad, in a way
Ross: Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person
Monica: Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!  
 And Im sorry she died Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

Monica: Whats this?
Phoebe: Thats a dog, every house should have a dog
Monica: Not one that can pee on the roof
Phoebe: Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive
waste
Chandler:  And is this in case the house sneezes?
Phoebe: No, no, thats the ghost for the attic
Monica: I dont want a ghost
Phoebe: Well, nobody wants a ghost But youve got one, because the house
is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground
Ross: Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient
Indian burial ground? That would never happen
Phoebe: Okay, obviously you dont know much about the US government

Chandler: Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening 
Rachel: Hmm
Chandler: Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because
Joannas such a big, dull dud!
Joanna: Chandler is fantastic!!
Rachel: What?!
Joanna: Oh God, we just clicked! Yknow how people just click? Like he came
by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
Rachel: Oh, I
Joanna: Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good
heart?
Rachel: Oh, I know
Joanna: Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to
call, so put him straight through
Sophie: Isnt this great?!
Joanna: Dont spoil it
Joey: Come on baby, dont go Please? What do you say?
The Director:  Hello Oh! Its you Just ah, just
one-one sec  I am going to take this call When I continue, I hope that
there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing
to the moment! 
Joey:  That guys like a cartoon What do you see in him anyway?
Kate: He happens to be brilliant Which is more than I can say for that sweater
youre dating
Joey: Hey, Im not interested in her sweater! Its whats
underneath her sweater that counts And besides, since ah, since when do you care who
Im going out with?
Kate: I dont care Why, do you want me to care?
Joey: Do you want me to want you to care?
Kate: Do you?
Joey: What?
The Director:  Okay, Im afraid to say this, but lets pick
it up where we left off
Joey: Come on baby, dont go Please? What do you say?
Kate: Ive got no reason to stay 
The Director: Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a
terrible play! Ill see you in the morning 
Kate: I cant believe we go on in, in a week
Joey: Hey, its gonna be all right
Lauren:  Hey! So since were getting off early, do you want to go
and paint mugs?
Joey: What?
Lauren: You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Joey: Oh, yeah, with the mug painting Yeah I was so listening to that But ah,
y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight
Lauren: Oh, okay
Joey: Okay 
Lauren: Ill see you tomorrow 
Joey: Okay
Lauren: Gnight 
Joey:  Ah, are you okay?
Kate: Yeah, I guess Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
Joey: I dont know
Kate: Well umm, maybe if it had more heat
Joey: How do you mean?
Kate: Well, Adrians looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor cant
just kiss her, hes gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Joey: Maybe he could slip her the tongue
Kate: Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up
Joey: Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his
waist
Kate: And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his
stomach!
Joey: And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,
and, and bite her!
Kate: And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this
raw, animal
Joey: Something like that?
Kate: Yeah, thats pretty much what I had in mind
Joey: Yeah
Joey:  Hey
Ross: Hi
Joey:  Hey 
Ross: Hi
Joey: Hey
Ross: Its a little early to be drinkin
Joey: No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate
Ross: Ohhhhh!
Monica: Youre kidding?! Thats great!
Joey: Oh, it was so amazing After the  love making
Monica: Oh my
Joey: Yep I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in
and breathing out And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep
going like this 
Chandler:  Im telling ya, Joannas got it all
wrong Okay? All I said was, This was fun Lets do it again sometime
Ill give you a call
Rachel: Ohh, gee I wonder why she thinks youre going to call her?
Chandler: Thats what you say at the end of a date
Rachel: You cant just say, Nice to meet you, good night?
Chandler: To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing
there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her
and its just y'know, comes out I cant help it, its a compulsion
Monica: Come on Rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesnt
mean hes going to call Hasnt it ever happened to you?
Rachel: Well, they always called
Monica: Hmm, bite me
Joanna:  Did he call?
Rachel: No Sorry
Joanna: Why?! Why?! He said hed call Why hasnt he called?
Sophie: Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women
Joanna: Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt Why hasnt he
called, Rachel? Why?
Rachel: Okay, okay Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you
are my boss
Joanna: Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Rachel: Well
Joanna: The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt
tell him not to call me, did you?
Rachel: No I
Joanna: Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you
work for, there are always ways to fixthat
Rachel:  Call her! Call her now!
Chandler: Multiple, so many paper cuts
Rachel: Why hasnt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I dont understand
Why? He said hell call Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out,
shes gone crazy!
Chandler:  Oh, well give me the phone then
Rachel: Come on, this isnt funny She thinks its my fault that you
havent called her You have to call her!
Chandler: Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say,
In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!
Rachel: Well then youre going to have to take her out again
Chandler: Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop
thing in the corner of her eye!
Rachel: I dont care! I dont care! You are going to have to take her
out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended And, I
dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Chandler: All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than an
hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody
ever again!
Rachel: Thats fine!
Chandler: Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know
Rachel: I know
Ross: Mon?
Monica:  Im in the shower!
something and turns around to see Phoebes dollhouse smoking He runs over and takes
Ross: Oh, fire! There, theres a fire! Fire!!
to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since Monica is in the shower the water
pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass In desperation he takes the
half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesnt work He then picks up the
dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the
bathroom and use the shower to put it out He kicks open the door and we hear Monica
Joey: Hey
Kate: Hi
Joey: So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us Did you
ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Kate: About what?
Joey: Y'know, about what happened with us
Kate: Nooo And theres really no reason he should find out, so ah
lets not make a big deal about it, okay?
Joey: What are you talking about? It was a big deal I mean, come on you
cant tell me last night didnt mean something to you I-I was there,
youre not that good an actress
Kate: Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment Thats all it
was Joey, Im-Im sorry you feel bad, but havent you ever sleep with a
women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Joey: Nooo
Lauren:  Hi, Kate!
Kate: Hi, Lauren
Joey: Hi, Lauren
Lauren: Hi, pig!
Ross: Sorry I ah, I scared you in there
Monica: Oh, thats okay By the way, I was just checking the shower
massager
Ross: Yeah
Phoebe:  Hey!
Monica:  I tried to reach you at work Theresbeen a
fire
Phoebe: What?! Oh my  Oh my God!! What
happened?!
Ross: Well, we believe it originated here 
 In the Aroma Room
Phoebe: All right Did everyone get out okay?
Monica: Well, the giraffes okay And so is the pirate
Phoebe: Ohh What is this? 
Ross: No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under
there!!
Phoebe:  Ohh, the-the
Foster puppets! 
Chandler: Its not a big deal Its, just its right here,
 and its all the time
Joanna: Well, thanks again for lunch
Chandler:  Yes, this, this was
pleasant

Chandler: Noo! 
Rachel: Chandler!!
Chandler: Look, Im sorry Okay? Im weak, and pathetic, and sorry
Rachel: Okay, you are going to tell her and youre going to tell her now
Chandler: AhhhhIm not going to call you
Joanna: What?
Chandler: Im sorry Im-Im-Im sorry that I said I was
going to when Im not Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this
isnt Rachels fault Its me I have serious, serious problems when it
comes to women I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop And
Im really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out
Joanna: Well, this isnt how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I
have to appreciate your honesty
Chandler: Yeah, o-okay
Joanna: So
Chandler: Well this is great! Ill give you a call! We should do it again
sometime!
Joey:  Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve
considered your feelings before I went home with you that night Ive ah, Ive

Chandler:  Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Ross: Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally
benign
Joey: Well what is it?!
Ross: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin
abnormality And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify
it, he was reluctant to remove it
Chandler: Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there
with my third nipple He just lopped it right off Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky I mean
not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples
Ross: At least they knew what yours was Y'know, yours had a name
Joey: Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross
And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross"
Ross:  Yeah, that'd be cool!
Monica: Pete's breaking up with me
All: What?!
Monica: I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from
Atlanta, we need to talk
Rachel: And?
Monica: Well that's it People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something
bad
Joey: Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you
Monica: Really?!
Joey: Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you
Jason: and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty
cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life
Phoebe: That is so great! Oh, I 
 Oh my God!
Jason: Whoa!
Phoebe:  Oh my God!!!
Jason: Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!

Joey: Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them
Phoebe:  and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,
always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one It's making me crazy
Rachel: Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Phoebe:  Uh
Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa What ah, what happened to playing the field?

Phoebe: Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, its just Jasons so

having just like a really, really, really nice  butt

All: Good luck!
Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!

Phoebe: Oh my God, I didnt
Vince:  Im sorry, I cant talk Im gonna go

tell their friends about it
Ross: Gimme this 
Rachel:  Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt
resist
Monica: Brides magazines?

sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin 
Phoebe:  Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway 
 Like for clubbing 
Monica: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in
bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes 
 I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and
its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I
cant Right? I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the
same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy
Rachel: Oh my God  
Monica: I know  I need more pie 
Phoebe: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Rachel: You didnt break up with that fireman?
Phoebe: No, that was my way of telling you Well, it turns out hes
incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints He even showed me charcoal
drawings that he drew of me
Rachel: Wow!
Phoebe: Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access
to a lot of charcoal
Monica: So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Phoebe: Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so
Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince

get you Y'know just ah, dont turn your back to him
Joey: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson Y'know? What you could do is you
could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to
smack ya, his hand will smell  Now what could you rub on your butt that
would smell bad?
Chandler:  What if Joey were president?
Phoebe: Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Rachel: Yeah
Phoebe: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I
set Ross up on a date?
Rachel: Oh, ah with who?
Phoebe: Umm, my friend, Bonnie She just always thought Ross was really cute,
and now that you two arent together, she asked if I could set it up, but if
youre not cool with it
Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Phoebe: You remember her from my birthday party two years ago Shes yeah,
like, average height, medium build, bald
Rachel: Oh!  Thats fine
Phoebe: Great! Okay, good for you!

Rachel: Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick
I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Phoebe: Well, maybe it wont work out Maybe Ross wont like her

Monica: I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it And now
you can just look back at this thing with no regrets
Pete: What, look back?

Champion
Monica: That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Pete: Let me tell you a story When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think
it just happened overnight? No There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dads garage,
there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I
learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck
Monica: You didnt know that already?
Pete: Look, Im gonna get better Okay? I promise you
Monica: Okay, just get a lot better  Fast
Pete: Oh, one other thing Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have
affected my concentration
Monica: Yeah That-that was the problem

 Thank you 
Phoebe: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Ross: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all,
I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really
terrific
Phoebe: Ohh, thats too bad!
Ross: No, I-Im saying I liked her
Phoebe: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea
Ross: Pheebs, I think shes great Okay? Were going out again
Phoebe: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Chandler:  Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
Ross: Ahh, the one next to my foot Sorry
Joey:  Hey, the fights starting!
Ross: Okay, well be right in  So ah, did your boss try to
slap you again today?
Chandler: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be
okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as
planned, my butt will be smack free
Joey:  Fights over!
Chandler: Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!
Doug:  Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Chandler: No, I ah, I didnt do them
Doug: Oh, you forgot?
Chandler: No, no I just ah, didnt do them Instead, I ah, hung out with a
couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise,
verbal or otherwise
Doug: Well, I got tanked myself last night Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi
Bridge never looked smaller  Thats okay, youre still my number one
guy!  Bing!
Chandler: Doug!!
Doug: Hmm
Chandler: Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express
yourself
Doug: Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I
gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just kiss my ass!
Chandler: No, no It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah,
the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock
Doug: Oh?
Chandler: Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment Its
just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all
the other guys jealous
Doug: Well, say no more Y'know it takes guts to bring this up Bing!
Youre okay
Chandler: Okay 
Doug: Ha! 
Ahhhhhhh!
Chandler: Ahhhhh! 
Phoebe: Okay Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or
inside his shower drain?
Rachel:  Oh my God! Phoebe look,
its Ross and that girl
Phoebe: No! No! Look at that!  Its a line
of ants! Theyre working as a team!
Rachel: Phoebe! 
Phoebe:  Right, oh yeah Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is
breaking up with her Uff, I hope he lets her down easy Lets go
Rachel: Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them
Okay thats, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, thats
what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh
Phoebe: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive
Rachel: Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now
he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault
Phoebe: You said it was okay!
Rachel: You said she was bald!!
Phoebe: What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Rachel: Phoebe, we cant, we just cant just let it happen! Okay, we
have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her
head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Phoebe: Okay, first of all, breathe Second of all, I dont get it
Arent you the one that decided that you didnt want to be with Ross?
Rachel:  Yes
Phoebe: Well isnt he your friend? Dont you want him to be happy?
Rachel: Yes

Phoebe:  Oh no
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Oh, we killed them all
Rachel: Oh! 
Pete: Its okay, its not as bad as it looks, its a precaution
Ah, Im not supposed to move my spine
Monica: Please tell me youre stopping now
Pete: Im fine! Id fight tonight, if theyd let me 
 See this circle Im marking off here? This is my zone
of terror
Monica: You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Pete: I cant until Im the ultimate fighter I will do it Im
telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or
Superman Now, Im not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid
Monica: Sit down All right? Please, just listen to me You are terrible at
this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! 
Pete: Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right
forearm, and a severely bruised Adams Apple, but that really hurt
Monica: Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt
yourself like this So if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do it
without me
Pete: Well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be
someone Im not Ive got to do this
Monica: Then Ive gotta go Bye 
Pete: Mon-Monica?
Monica: Yes?
Pete: Could you leave a note? Cause Im on a lot of pain killers now,
and I dont know if Ill remember this tomorrow
