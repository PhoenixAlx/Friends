<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you realize this is probably the last time we&#146;ll all be here in
the coffee house as six single people?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why?! What&#146;s happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.)
Oh! (Realizes.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the
misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Old?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The young hot ball and chain.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s much better.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, where are you guys going?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We&#146;re gonna pick up the wedding dress then we&#146;re gonna have
lunch with mom. (Joey stands up.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah. Joey you&#146;re-you&#146;re having lunch with my mom?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! (They all exit.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Chandler) Y&#146;know what? Actually I&#146;m kinda glad they&#146;re
leaving &#145;cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I&#146;m
buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, its&#133;Its not that. Umm, now what I&#146;m going to say to you,
I&#146;m <b>not</b> saying as your friend. Okay? I&#146;m-I&#146;m saying as it as
Monica&#146;s older brother.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But you&#146;re still my friend?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not for the next few minutes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> During this time&#133;are you, are you still my best man?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do I still call you Ross?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn&#146;t be
more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica&#146;s older brother I-I have to tell you
this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any
kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What?
I&#146;m-I&#146;m-I&#146;m serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) Come&#151;Hey! Dude! Stop
it! Okay? I&#146;m-I&#146;m not kidding here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the
warning.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No problem.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So are we&#133;friends again?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (Pause) You won&#146;t <b>believe</b> what Monica&#146;s older
brother just said to me!</p>

cookies.] </p>

<p><b>The Assistant Director:</b> (approaching) Hey Joey! We&#146;re ready.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Me too. (He pats his pocket.)</p>

<p><b>The Assistant Director:</b> (to another actor) Richard? We&#146;re ready for you.
(Richard approaches.) Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he&#146;s playing Vincent.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I&#146;m doing my scenes with you?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Nice to meet you Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow! I can&#146;t believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an
Oscar!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> No I didn&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I think you did.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> I think I lost. Three times.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh&#133;Cookie?</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> (approaching) Okay! We&#146;re about an hour away from getting the
scene lit. So uh, if you guys don&#146;t mind, can we run it a couple of times?</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Okay, all right. Let&#146;s do it. (He walks off.)
And&#133;Action!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We have to find the rest of the platoon!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone! (He is spitting on the hard Ps

<p><b>Joey:</b> (wiping his face) What?!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> (still spitting) The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (wipes face) So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no
food!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry
pasta!</p>

<p>(Joey wipes his eye.)</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something
wrong?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uh&#133;I th&#151;I thought it might be
kind of a cool character thing. Y&#146;know? He&#146;s uh, he&#146;s a face toucher.
(Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)</p>

<p><b>The Director:</b> I don&#146;t think so. Let&#146;s take it back to Richard&#146;s
last line. (Walks off.) Action!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I
saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna! (Joey backs away and wipes his
face again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is standing in the kitchen ready to leave for the
rehearsal dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, we gotta go!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering from the bedroom) Okay. Here&#146;s a question you never
have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl
necklaces.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) I don&#146;t have anything like that, but let me go see if
Rachel does.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I just, I can&#146;t believe that we made it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well you don&#146;t have to sound so surprised.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m sorry but&#133;nothing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well&#133;honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for
something to, to flip you out.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Honestly? Me too.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Y&#146;know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come
up and I&#146;ll go all&#133;Chandler. But nothing has.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, I&#146;m so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during
this. I mean it&#146;s really, it&#146;s made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.)
I coulda been worse!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. I&#146;ll be right there.</p>

<p>(She exits and as Chandler picks up his coat, the phone rings and the answering machine
gets it.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (voice on answering machine) Hi! If you&#146;re calling before Saturday,
you&#146;ve reached Monica and Chandler. But if you&#146;re calling after Saturday,
you&#146;ve reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!</p>

chat with Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What is that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I&#133;I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and
kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I
am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ross, please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)</p>

<p>(Chandler&#146;s Mom enters and Chandler meets her by the door.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (She&#146;s wearing a
tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad
this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there&#146;ll be lots of little Bings.
(He freaks out and loosens the tie again.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (shaking her hand) It&#146;s lovely to meet you.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Jack!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> What?! I&#146;ve never seen one before!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Dad! There&#146;s Ross (points), why don&#146;t you go talk to him?</p>

<p>(Mr. and Mrs. Geller start to walk away.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I didn&#146;t even have a chance to act as though I&#146;m okay with
it!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Bing:</b> (entering) Hello all!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Charles.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It-it&#146;s so great to see you both here.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Bing:</b> Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some
people. Aren&#146;t you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Don&#146;t you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress
like that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller talking to Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> &#133;of course you can kick his ass son.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> You could kick anyone&#146;s ass you want too.</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to
Chandler&#146;s dad and try to keep him away from Chandler&#146;s mom?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! But I don&#146;t know what he looks like!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He is the man in the black dress.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Man in the black dress&#133; (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around
to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! I&#146;m Rachel! I&#146;m a friend of
Monica and Chandler&#146;s!</p>

<p><b>Woman:</b> I&#146;m Amanda.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Dad&#133;dad, please! As I was saying umm, I&#146;m Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh,
and I&#146;m the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not

the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you&#146;d all please join me in raising a
glass to the, the couple we&#146;re here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings.</p>

<p><b>All:</b> To the Bings!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are in the kitchen.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I&#146;m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the
responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;ll do it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Who wants it? Anybody?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I said I&#146;ll do it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Nobody wants to do it? All right, I&#146;ll do it myself.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica! I&#146;m not gonna screw it up!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know what? You&#146;re right, I&#146;m sorry. Actually you were a
big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure
she got to the hotel safely.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well of course that is what I&#146;m here for!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is wearing sunglasses and as he exits his bedroom, Ross
enters the apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Where have you been?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Are you going back to work?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Nice shades.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won&#146;t
get spit in the eyes, y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And if I remember correctly, <i>Ray Ban</i> was the official sponsor of
World War I!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Great! All right. I&#146;ll see you later. (He starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, where&#146;s Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, I think he&#146;s in Rachel&#146;s room. See ya. (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (going up to Rachel&#146;s closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and
looks inside and doesn&#146;t see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still
doesn&#146;t find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe and Rachel are in the kitchen as there is a knock
on the door. Rachel answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is uh, is Monica here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> She&#146;s steaming her dress, why? What&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think Chandler&#146;s gone. (He hands her the note.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> He left that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (reading the note) Tell Monica I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (walking up) What&#146;s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads
it.) Tell Monica I&#146;m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The Hallway, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel are discussing the note.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! Chandler just left though!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah but, maybe it&#146;s not what we think. Maybe it&#146;s tell Monica
I&#146;m sorry I&#133;drank the last of the milk.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he&#146;s changed his
name, y&#146;know? Tell Monica I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think it means he freaked out and left!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Don&#146;t be so negative! Good God! Isn&#146;t it possible that Sorry
is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel&#146;s apartment) right now?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look&#151;Okay, I&#146;m just gonna&#151;I&#146;m gonna have to go find
him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (pointing at Ross) Okay <b>but</b> if you don&#146;t find him and bring
him back, I am gonna hunt <b>you</b> down and kick <b>your</b> ass!</p>

<p>(Ross laughs and Phoebe points harder.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (scared) I will, I will find him.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Movie Set, Joey is getting his make-up touched up as Richard approaches.]</p>

can uh, play off your reaction.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay uh, look I know you&#146;re a great actor, okay? And you play all
those Shakespeare guys and stuff&#133;</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Well of course I am!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You <b>know</b> you&#146;ve been spitting on me?!</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> That&#146;s what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good
actor! And when you enunciate, you spit! (Spits on the t) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (wiping face) Wow! Didn&#146;t know that.</p>

<p><b>Richard:</b> Great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! (Reading from the script) Picture? What
picture? (He pauses then spits) Eh?</p>

What-what&#133;what you guys doing here?!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we&#146;d
see what all the fuss is about.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> The sexy blonde behind the counter. (She waves at Gunther who waves
back.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (shocked) Gunther?!</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Your mother just added him to her list.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Your-your list?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Yeah, the list that&#151;of people we&#146;re allowed to
sleep&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see
Chandler, could you just let him know I&#146;m looking for him?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, the next morning, Rachel and Phoebe are eating
breakfast.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (closing the door) Ross said there&#146;s still no word from Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh man.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth
avenue.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Well there&#146;s one down.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her room, excitedly) I&#146;m getting married today!!!
(She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I don&#146;t care
because today&#146;s my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&#146;know she might not even notice he&#146;s gone.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (re-entering) I&#146;m gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her
room.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> God! Don&#146;t&#151;We can&#146;t let her start getting ready! This is
too awful! Oh God, but wait she&#146;ll be in the gown and then he won&#146;t show up and
then she&#146;s gonna have to take off the gown&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can&#146;t do this here! (She drags
her into the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m sorry. It&#146;s just&#133;It&#146;s just so
sad!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but you&#146;ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can&#146;t
see you like this! Then she&#146;ll know something&#146;s wrong!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There&#146;s no tissue! Can you
grab me some toilet paper?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, that&#146;s gone too. This <b>is</b> Monica&#146;s
bathroom right?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no! I-I&#133;I found one.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(Phoebe reaches into the trash can, pulls one out, and hands it to Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have
another one?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you
need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler
doesn&#146;t show up!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh here&#146;s a whole bunch.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I mean she&#146;s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people
will be whispering, &quot;Oh that poor girl.&quot; Y&#146;know? Then she&#146;ll have to
come back here and live all alone.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it&#146;s positive.
Monica&#146;s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won&#146;t be totally
alone.</p>
