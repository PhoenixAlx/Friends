616.}</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Carol's, Carol is working on something at the table and Ross is
reading a newspaper on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna
start to find&#133;</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Ooh, actually I&#146;ve been making a list of all the women I know who
might be into doing this!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to
another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someone&#146;s
been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I know. (Laughs) Y&#146;know, just-just talking about it is getting me
kinda&#133;</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, me too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben&#146;s asleep.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh umm, y&#146;know I think it would be better if we just save it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The hospital, Chandler and Monica are there with Phoebe as Ross enters.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, how&#146;s it going?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I&#146;ve got to get out of this bed, I&#146;m going crazy here.
Crazy!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> But, I put some honey in it.</p>

<p>(Phoebe mocks what Monica just said. Ross pulls Chandler aside.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She doesn&#146;t know she was fired yet, does she?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, the doctors say it may kill her.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you two girls whispering about over there?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) But <b>I</b> think we should tell her.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you
should start think about getting a different job.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
(Points at Ross.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen Phoebe, he&#146;s right. People are not supposed to have heart
attacks at 31.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know! But if I didn&#146;t work there, what else would I do?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, you used to like playing the guitar.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, what about y&#146;know the massage thing? That never gave you a
heart attack.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked
people for chump change&#151;ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's apartment, (The one he had when he was Dr. Drake Remoray, because he
still is.) Rachel is there and admiring the big ceramic fake dog.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, I mean it&#146;s just so realistic!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on
polls. You&#146;ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you&#151;ready for a refill?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I probably shouldn&#146;t&#151;so I will! (Joey starts making her
refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It&#146;s like it&#146;s
raining!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Pretty cool, huh? But if you&#146;re thinking you can put a fish in there
and it wouldn&#146;t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you&#146;d be wrong.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, can I use your bathroom?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s uh, right through there. (Points.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (Starts to go.) God y&#146;know, if someone told me a week ago
that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani&#146;s apartment&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, life&#146;s pretty great isn&#146;t it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, it sure is!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is pouring wine for her boyfriend, Dr. Roger.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I hope you&#146;re hungry, we&#146;re starting with oysters. And
y&#146;know what they say about oysters, don&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> They have parasites?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> What people?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)</p>

<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> So oysters, huh?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And then we&#146;re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous.
Something we can eat, with our hands.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> Y&#146;know, it&#146;s funny, but when we were studying communicable
diseases&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no-no, no! It&#146;s sensual!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> Ohh! Didn&#146;t know! Okay! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!</p>

<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> I&#146;m sorry sweetie, it&#146;s the hospital. The food looks great,
maybe save me some?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&#146;t promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Carol's, Ross and Carol are waiting anxiously for their new partner to
arrive.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We&#146;re really gonna do this, huh?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Looks like it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&#146;know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out
at&#133; (A knock on the door interrupts him.)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (jumping up to get it) I got it!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Who&#146;d you think it was gonna be?)</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Hey! (They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Thank you so much for coming.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, I wouldn&#146;t miss it for the world.</p>

<p>(They start moving towards the bedroom, never taking their eyes off each other. They
move past Ross and stop.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m-I&#146;m Ross by the way.</p>

<p><b>Susan:</b> (not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and hands
it to him.) I love what you&#146;ve done with this space.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Thank you so much.</p>

<p>(They disappear into the bedroom leaving Ross standing in the living room holding
Susan&#146;s coat.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are eating Monica&#146;s dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m sorry you&#146;re here with me instead of Roger.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, me too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I could make it seem like he&#146;s here. (Imitates him.)
&quot;Here&#146;s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn&#146;t add the second
cous until 1979.&quot; (Mumbles something further.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Stop it!! That&#146;s not funny!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m sorry, okay? It just&#151;tonight was supposed to be
y&#146;know, it was supposed to be a big deal.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What was tonight?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You don&#146;t want to know what tonight was.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, tonight was&#151;was going to be my first time.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica
shrugs.) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right relax Mr. I&#146;ve Had Sex Four Times!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Four different women! I&#146;ve had sex way more times!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> How many?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I was just waiting for the perfect guy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect
guy?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. He&#146;s not a horrible guy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey that&#146;s what I tell girls about me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, I&#146;m gonna die a virgin!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen
for you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I was kidding.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So was I.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's apartment, Rachel is now three sheets to the wind and Joey is watching
her.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, you&#146;re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know
where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I
pretty much have to make it up on my own.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! Tell me something Joey&#151;(She falls off the couch)&#151;Whoa! I
just fell right off the couch there.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah you did.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Here you go. Let me ask you a question.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t feel my hands.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come, come here. </p>

<p>(He takes her hands in his and kisses each one, then kisses her on the lips. When the
break the kiss, Rachel starts to get nauseous and throw up. Joey backs away in horror.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, continued from earlier. Monica and Chandler are still
discussing the previous question.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We can&#146;t do this.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of
pressure on me, y&#146;know? Because you&#146;ve been waiting a very long time and I
wouldn&#146;t want to disappoint you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you&#146;re
horrible, how would I know?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I do like that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for
tonight, right?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out
another friend. (Points at herself.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stop it! We&#146;re doing this! Let&#146;s do it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Noo!! Okay!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay! (They both get up.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I have some moves.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs
away.) Okay, whatcha doin&#146; there?! (Giggles.) Oh y&#146;know what? I&#146;m sorry,
this is just too weird.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, let&#146;s just forget it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p>(She turns out the lights and in the darkened room Chandler starts to moan.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sexily) Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s the couch.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey's apartment, the next morning, Rachel is passed out on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Morning!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (groans) Oh God. Oh I can&#146;t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw
up!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well he actually saw you a little bit too.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo! Oh God we did&#151;we didn&#146;t, we didn&#146;t uhh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No! No, not after seeing that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> God I&#146;m just a horrible person.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wh-why?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because I&#146;m married. That&#146;s right, I am a married woman! And I
came to a TV star&#146;s apartment to have an affair! Uck!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s ridiculous! I&#146;m not a &quot;Star,&quot; just a regular
famous actor.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah and I&#146;m a horrible, horrible person.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show
when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The ring from the cave, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow! Uh okay, well uh&#133; (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the
ring.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure! As long as they don&#146;t find out you can keep whatever you want!
And I want you to have it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Rachel:</b> No! No-no-no&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that <b>you</b>
are a good person. Okay, you&#146;ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you
didn&#146;t. And that&#146;s what this ring stands for.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I thought that ring stood for Caprice&#146;s undying love for her
brother.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, do you want the ring or not?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe&#146;s hospital room, Joey and Ross enter as Phoebe comes out of the
bathroom wearing her robe.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look at you! You&#146;re up!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I thought I&#146;d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water?
I&#146;ll be back soon.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa! You&#146;re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are
ya?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. I&#146;ve learned my lesson.</p>

<p>(She goes out into the hall and when she&#146;s there and the door is closed; she rips
off her robe to reveal her work clothes.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Let&#146;s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old
man who&#146;s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.)
Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)</p>

<p>[Cut back to her room, Joey and Ross are sitting there waiting for her.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Joe did&#133; Did you ever have a threesome?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think
Carol&#146;s great and I&#146;m sure you&#146;re a very attractive man, but I&#133;.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No! The reason I&#146;m asking is that&#133; I sorta had one last night.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Huh. But still Ross, you&#146;re worst day with two women, pretty much
better than any other day! Y&#146;know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, absolutely!</p>

<p>(They both laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and
then there was a lot of waiting around.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But you got to be with both of them, right?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Not the other one?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, she kept kicking me away!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you don&#146;t want that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Me? I&#146;m great! I&#146;m fine! I&#146;m sooo good!! But, you know
who&#146;s not great?! Men! You&#146;re a man right Ross?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sit down! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. (He does so.) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean <b>squat</b>
to you people?! And why is it that the <b>second</b> we tell you we&#146;re going out of
town, <b>bamn</b> there you are in bed with the neighbor&#146;s dog walker?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We&#146;re sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No seriously! Seriously! <b>What</b> has happened to the sanctity of
marriage?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Didn&#146;t you spend last night at Joey&#146;s?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aw what are you?! A detective?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look I-I don&#146;t know what&#146;s going on with you and your husband
and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (Doesn&#146;t believe it.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! There are <b>some</b> men who will do whatever it takes to make their
marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives
engage in-in what only can be described as a <b>two</b>some with some-some woman she
barely knows from the gym!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who are these men?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Men. I guy I know.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers)
gay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She is not&#133; (Realizes) She&#146;s gay. Oh my God. She is <b>so</b>
gay! I can&#146;t believe this.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good day for married people huh?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sorry your husband cheated on you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren&#146;t that great
either.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Try telling my wife that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Monica is blowing out a candle as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would you do that?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because you shouldn&#146;t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with
me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look,
things like last night they don&#146;t just happen. Y&#146;know? Or at least not to me. Or
with the other two women, in the morning y&#146;know I was just lying there and I
couldn&#146;t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y&#146;know
with a friend.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know you probably don&#146;t want to go out with me, y&#146;know
because I make too many jokes and I&#146;ve never been in a serious relationship and I
guess I&#146;m not technically a &quot;doctor&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>(Monica runs over and kisses him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> There was just one woman, wasn&#146;t there?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, there were two.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Including me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
